State
^^^^^

*Style/state* is a prototype object that defines the fields that will be
part of the face/state object.

These fields are used to state information, not attributes or
properties. See link:GUI Faces[GUI Faces] for details.

<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 CELLSPACING=10><TR><TD WIDTH=50% VALIGN=TOP>
*Face/state* keeps track of special values that are not considered to be
attributes or properties of the face. For example, for simple buttons,
this is where we keep track of over and selected states. For other face
types, such as scroll bars, this is where we would store values like the
scroll and delta percentages. </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP> Example of scrollbar
state:

` value: 0% ; scroller offset` +
` delta: 10%    ; "page size" increment`

The state object is normally quite small and gets expanded as necessary
for specific styles that require extra fields. </TD></TR></TABLE>
