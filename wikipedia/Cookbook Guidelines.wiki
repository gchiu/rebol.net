==Adding a Cookbook==

{{Hilight|Thank you for adding to DocBase}}

First, you'll need to initiate a new DocBase page. The easiest way is to type your preferred page title into the Search field of the DocBase Navigation section and press Go.

While not totally necessary, cookbooks should start with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Cookbook}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template.  This template accepts 4 parameters.  A '''title''', an '''author''', a difficulty '''level''' and a '''category'''.

*title does not need to be the same as the page title.  Use something short and snappy.  If not included a generic '''REBOL Recipe''' will be used.
*author would be what ever credit you would like.  If not included '''Incognito''' will be used.
*level is a number from 1 to 3.  1 matches ''Beginner'', 2 for ''Intermediate'' and 3 for 'Advanced''. 2 is default.
*category should be Tip, Code, Networking, Data Processing etcetera.  Defaults to '''Code'''.

===Example 1===
&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Cookbook|title=Handling Binary Data|level=3|category=Code}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Would produce
{{Cookbook|title=Handling Binary Data|level=3|category=Code}}

===Example 2===
&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Cookbook|title=Client Server|author=Luke Lakeswimmer|level=2|category=Networking}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
produces
{{Cookbook|title=Client Server|author=Luke Lakeswimmer|level=2|category=Networking}}
