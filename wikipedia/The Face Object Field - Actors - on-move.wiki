'''on-move''' is invoked every time the mouse moves, but is not performing dragging. It is invoked just prior to the '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-over|on-over]]''' event.

The input argument is the event object.

No return value is necessary.

===Examples===

 on-move: [
   ; Write some.
