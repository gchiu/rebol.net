'''on-drag''' is invoked when a drag object has been created and the mouse is moving inside the face in which the drag object was created.

on-drag usually comes after '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-click|on-click]]''' and ceases to be used when the drag object is destroyed, which happens right after '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-drop|on-drop]]'''.

The drag object the input argument to the on-drag actor. No return value is necessary.

When a drag object exists, the '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-move|on-move]]''' and '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-over|on-over]]''' actors are not called.

===Examples===

Slider updates value constantly during drag and performs its face action:

 on-drag: [
   do-style face 'on-offset arg/delta + arg/base
   draw-face face
   do-face face
 ]
