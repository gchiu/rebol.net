'''Additional notes about LINE-CAP and LINE-JOIN'''
<pre>
How are lines drawn

LINE - draws single lines (even if multiple line points is specified)
SPLINE - draws 'connected' lines but the 'head' and 'tail' is splitted (until you specify CLOSED keyword)
POLYGON - always draws 'connected' lines in form of closed shape

What does LINE-CAP and LINE-JOIN

LINE - shape of 'head' and 'tail' is affected by LINE-CAP mode
SPLINE - shape of 'line joins' is affected by LINE-JOIN mode
		 if CLOSED is defined shape of 'head' and 'tail' is affected by LINE-CAP mode
POLYGON - shape of all 'line joins' is affected by LINE-JOIN mode
