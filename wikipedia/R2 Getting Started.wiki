Getting started with Linux is slightly different see: [[Setting up in Linux]] .

==Examples==

In the Rebol desktop click on the Rebol icon at the top, select DEMOS and choose one. With left mouse click you start the demo. With right mouse click you see the notes and if you click on the EDIT button the source of the demo will open.

You will be amazed of how small are all Rebol applications.
