This page documents a number of pending issues in the R3 definition, design, or implementation.

==Math Operations for Percent==

We must precisely define how math for percent works. It makes sense that:

   5% + 10% = 15%

But does:

   5% + 10 = 10.5 or 15?

And, the same is true for:

   10 + 5%

==Set-Words in Function Specs==

Set-words in function specs will get a new meaning to allow special function modes. It has been used in ROUTINE! specs before, but how this works for functions is still being defined (and it is non-essential to beta 1 release.)

Examples:

    f1: func [a [integer!] return: [integer!]]
    f2: func [a b options: [protect]]
    f3: func [a b trace: [enter exit]]
    f4: func [a b trace: [step]]
    f5: func [a b catch: [all]]

==Function Input Stream Access==

Should a function have access to its input evaluation stream. For example, if F1 is a function, do we allow:

    F1 10 "test"

where F1 can access the block from the point of [10 "test"].

It may be possible to redefine the :word function spec meaning (which does almost the same thing as 'word) to allow this.

==Smart Mold of Function!==

Should we allow functions to MOLD back to FUNC, DOES, HAS, etc.? It is not a major change to do so.

==Smart Mold of Bitset!==

Should MOLD on a bitset return a string or block similar to normal bitset specs?  More user friendly. Not, some cases may remain as binary, to avoid odd characters in strings.
