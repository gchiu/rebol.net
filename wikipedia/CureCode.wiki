For bug reports and enhancement requests.

==Summary==

For 3.0 bug reporting and enhancement requests we use '''CureCode''', written and hosted by [http://softinnov.org/ Softinnov].

The web site interface can be found at http://curecode.org/rebol3/

==Basics==

It's pretty obvious when you look at it.

'''No account is needed''' to view and search tickets.

'''To submit or change a ticket requires an account.''' But, it is easy and fast [http://curecode.org/rebol3/register.rsp to register] (also via the link at the top of the page.)

You can also modify the state of tickets that you've submitted earlier.

==Questions==

*Q:
**Does it have a REBOL interface?
**Although it runs in REBOL via the Cheyenne web server, there is currently no direct REBOL interface, but there are plans to add it later.
*Q:
**Can it be enhanced?
**Several enhancements have already been made, and you can submit your suggestions to Softinnov. In addition, the source code is available, so you can help with bugs and enhancements.

==API documentation==
<blockquote>
''Main features :''
* ''retrieve a list of tickets based on preset filters''
* ''retrieve whole details about a given ticket ID''
* ''returned data are in REBOL format (XML support pending)''
* ''doesn't support yet adding or modifying tickets''

''The current API should be considered alpha.''
</blockquote>

===Query format===

CureCode API URLs must be in the following format:
<pre>
    http://curecode.org/rebol3/api.rsp?<parameter 1>&<parameter 2>&<parameter n> 
</pre>
Parameters are separated using the ampersand character (&). You can specify as many parameters as you like, in any order. Parameters can be passed in URL or as POST data.

===Response format===

All responses are encapsulated using the following format :
<pre>
    [<status> <data>]
</pre>	
<span style="color:green">'''<tt><status></tt>'''</span> is a ''word!'' value informing about the completion of the request :
<blockquote>
* '''<tt>ok</tt>''' : valid request, <span style="color:green">'''<tt><data></tt>'''</span> can be a ''block!'' or ''integer!'' value.
* '''<tt>error</tt>''' : invalid request, <span style="color:green">'''<tt><data></tt>'''</span> will be a ''string!'' containing an error message.

<pre>
    [ok 492]
    [ok [403 202 404]]
    [ok [summary: "Crash calling BROWSE function" description:...]]

    [error "FILTER argument is invalid"]
</pre>
You can use LOAD to query the remote API and get REBOL data back. If you don't trust the server, you can use LOAD/ALL or READ instead.
<pre>
    >> load http://curecode.org/rebol3/api.rsp?type=list&filter=2&mode=count
    == [ok 492]

    >> read http://curecode.org/rebol3/api.rsp?type=list&filter=2&mode=count
    == "[ok 492]"
</pre>
</blockquote>

'''''Note 2''''': ''The <tt>count</tt> mode main usage is to allow paging preparation for long lists.''
</blockquote>

*<tt>range=<span style="color:green">'''<part>'''</span></tt>

<blockquote>
<span style="color:green">'''<tt><part></tt>'''</span> parameter is a ''pair!'' value defining a sub-list. First value indicates the lower bound (>=1) and the second one the upper bound value.

    ]]
</pre>

'''''Note''''': ''A query like'' <span style="color:green">'''<tt>type=list&filter=1&range=1x1</tt>'''</span> ''will give you the last submitted ticket. This can be use in a native client for notifying user when a new ticket is posted.''
