'''on-focus''' is invoked every time the face is gaining focus using the FOCUS or NEXT-FOCUS function or losing focus with the UNFOCUS function.

Nothing is called after on-focus, so if the face is changing appearance, a SHOW-LATER should be added in the actor.

The argument is TRUE for focus and NONE for unfocus.

No return value is necessary.

===Examples===

Make the background color 'yello when the face is in focus. Make it 'white, when the face is unfocused.

 on-focus: [
   face/facets/back-color: pick reduce [yello white] arg
   show-later face
 ]
