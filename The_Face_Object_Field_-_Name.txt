*Style/name* is the name of the style as a word. This word is used to
refer to the style in a GUI dialect block as used by link:GUI Panels[ a
panel or group]. Every link:GUI Faces[ face] includes a reference to
this style name in order to access the attributes and behaviors of the
face.

Face/name holds a word that can be used to refer to the face from other
faces. For example, the name can be used to set its value, to reset the
face, or to clear it, etc.

When a panel is created, all face names are collected and used to create
a context for binding the face actions.

Note: for user coding convenience, the name of a face spans more than
just its definitional panel (or group). </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP> For
example, this code works as you would expect, even though the buttons
are part of a sub-panel, not the panel in which the field name was
defined:

` panel [` +
`     user: field` +
`     group [` +
`         button "Reset" reset 'user` +
`         button "Clear" clear 'user` +
`     ]` +
` ]`

In cases where it is necessary to open a new name-space, for example in
unrelated sub-panels, this can be done with the style/facet/names field.
See the link:GUI Panels[GUI Panels] document for more information.
