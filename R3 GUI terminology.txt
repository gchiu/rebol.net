Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We had a couple of discussions regarding the terminology unification in
R3 GUI. This page is devoted to list the related problems and to try to
look for the best possible solutions. If you are in doubt what a
particular notion means, you can consult the link:#Glossary[Glossary]
section below.


Layouts of faces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carl had the following definition in his documentation: "A panel is a
layout of faces."


Problems
^^^^^^^^

The trouble with the above terminology Carl coined and we still keep
using is, that the word 'panel' was used as a name of the style as well,
which means, that "a panel" could mean "an instance of the panel style"
instead. Using both senses makes the documentation (and code) rather
confusing.


Solution
^^^^^^^^

There were attempts to solve this problem by inventing a special notion
denoting the "layout of faces". One of such notions coined by Ladislav
was 'a container', another one coined by Cyphre was 'a compound', but,
it seems that the ideal notion to use is 'a layout' (coined by Cyphre).


Panel or hpanel?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the problems discussed was the question whether to use the notion
of 'panel' to describe the most common layout style or whether to use
the 'hpanel' word. There are these alternatives:

1.  use the current 'hpanel' word, use 'vpanel' for panels with vertical
layout mode
2.  use the 'panel' word, use 'vpanel' for panels with vertical layout
mode, that can be expected to be less common, substantiating the longer
name
3.  use the 'panel' word to represent panels with the horizontal as well
as with the vertical layout mode, the default layout mode being the more
frequent one, the vertical layout mode being specifiable by a longer
'panel vertical' expression using the word 'vertical' as an option to
specify the less frequent LAYOUT-MODE value


'Hpanel'/'vpanel' styles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Advantages
++++++++++

* The layout dialect looks more specific, not leaving space for doubts
about the layout mode of the panels at the first sight.

* The second advantage is terminological. 'A panel' means either a
hpanel or a vpanel in this case, which does not cause any confusion.


Disadvantages
+++++++++++++

* It is preferable to use the shortest name for the most frequent
variant, reserving a longer name only for the less frequent variant.
This argument favours other variants of naming. The practice is already
used in the case of the 'align'/'valign' alignment attribute variants.
Notice, that other graphic frameworks work that way too.

* The current 'hpanel' and 'vpanel' styles share the same blueprint in
fact, differing only by the value of the LAYOUT-MODE attribute, as this
example demonstrates:

<pre>view [ hpanel [button button] options [layout-mode: 'vertical]
]</pre>

The example actually creates a vpanel, as you may find out running it.
Thus, hpanels and vpanels differ only by their LAYOUT-MODE attribute
value, which can be easily switched during run time.

Taking that into account, there should be only one 'panel' blueprint,
the LAYOUT-MODE attribute of which should be either 'horizontal' by
default, or 'vertical', if specified otherwise by the user.


'Panel'/'vpanel' styles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Advantages
++++++++++

* The layout dialect respects the principle used in graphic frameworks
to use the shortest name for the most frequent case.


Disadvantages
+++++++++++++

* The layout dialect looks less specific at the first sight, the user
needs to know, that the 'panel' style has a horizontal LAYOUT-MODE by
default

* The current 'hpanel' and 'vpanel' styles share the same blueprint in
fact, differing only by the value of the LAYOUT-MODE attribute, as this
example demonstrates:

<pre>view [ hpanel [button button] options [layout-mode: 'vertical]
]</pre>

The example actually creates a vpanel, as you may find out running it.
Thus, hpanels and vpanels differ only by their LAYOUT-MODE attribute
value, which can be easily switched during run time.

Taking that into account, there should be only one 'panel' blueprint,
the LAYOUT-MODE attribute of which should be either 'horizontal' by
default, or 'vertical', if specified otherwise by the user.

* There is a terminological disadvantage. In this case we don't have a
common notion describing faces that are either panels or vpanels, and
the usage of 'a panel' notion becomes ambiguous in this sense.


Single 'panel' style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Advantages
++++++++++

* The layout dialect respects the principle used in graphic frameworks
to use the shortest name for the most frequent case.

* The usage of this variant acknowledges, that there is just one
blueprint for all panels, the LAYOUT-MODE being an attribute
settable/changeable at any time.

* Yet another advantage is terminological. 'A panel' means all faces
that are instances of the panel style.


Disadvantages
+++++++++++++

* The layout dialect looks less specific at the first sight, the user
needs to know, that the 'panel' style has horizontal LAYOUT-MODE by
default


Hgroup and vgroup

The main problems are similar as described in the previous section.


Glossary
~~~~~~~~

Face: A _face_ is a graphical object.

Gob: A _gob_ is a low-level graphical object.

Style: A _style_ is a blueprint used to create faces, instances of the
said style.

Layout: A _layout_ is a face serving as a layout of faces.

Layout style: A _layout style_ is a style used as a blueprint for layout
faces. We currently have e.g. the vpanel layout style in R3-GUI.
