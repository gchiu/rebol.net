REBOL has many functions for manipulating code and data in series and in
blocks with the purpose of storing them either on disk or moving them
across networks or media to have them restored to their original state
later. An example is ENCLOAK. Its opposite is DECLOAK. Here's a table
that describes such functions.

Insert table here which describes the relationships between:

* AS-STRING - AS-BINARY
* COMPRESS - DECOMPRESS
* DO - FORM
* DO - TO-BLOCK
* DO - TO-STRING
* ENBASE - DEBASE
* ENCLOAK - DECLOAK
* ENTAB - DETAB
* INPUT - PRINT
* LOAD - FORM
* LOAD - MOLD
* LOAD - SAVE
* READ - WRITE
* TO-LOCAL-FILE - TO-REBOL-FILE

I realize there might be 100s of combinations, but I hope also we can
make a clear table of combinations that work well together.
