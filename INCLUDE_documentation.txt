*Include* is a REBOL script processor. It is implemented as a function
and works as a REBOL script loader, preprocessor and evaluator. It is
not an "alternative module system", in fact, it is orthogonal to any
such system, meaning that it can work together with such a system.


Design features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  A comfortable REBOL script evaluator:
1.  Can preprocess and evaluate any script (the script does not have to
contain *prebol* directives).
2.  Processes *prebol* directives facilitating SDK debugging.
3.  During preprocessing errors are enhanced to inform in which file the
error occurred to make debugging more comfortable.
4.  Uses *include-ctx/path* which resembles paths of many operating
systems to search for scripts.
5.  *include-ctx/path* can contain URLs, not just local directories.
6.  *include/check* prevents scripts from being re-included (included
more than once).
7.  Processes ordinary scripts with REBOL header.
8.  Processes prefaced REBOL scripts, i.e., REBOL scripts with preface
preceding REBOL header and embedded REBOL scripts (see
http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-5.html#section-1.2[1]).
2.  An improved script loader:
1.  *include/only* just loads and preprocesses a script yielding a REBOL
block.
2.  *include/link* loads a script, preprocesses it and saves the result
to the specified file.
3.  An improved preprocessor:
1.  Processes all *prebol* directives and is compatible with SDK.
2.  The #include-check directive is available as a "don't re-include"
variant of the #include directive.
3.  It is possible to include small parts of scripts like binary data,
images or strings.
4.  Context encapsulation is available using the <code>make
object!</code> or the <code>make module!</code> method.
5.  Users can define new directives.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The preprocessing phase is used to build the script, i.e., to include
the necessary parts. Moreover, it enables the user to evaluate any REBOL
expression(s).


Standard preprocessing directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


<code>#include script</code>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Include a script (a file or URL) here. The script is preprocessed by
*include*.


<code>#include-check script</code>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The same as above, except that the script is not included if present in
the *include-ctx/log*.


<code>#do block</code>
++++++++++++++++++++++

Do the given code block during preprocessing including the result here
without preprocessing it further.


<code>#include-string text-file</code>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Include the given *text-file* as a string.


<code>#include-binary binary-file</code>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Include the given *binary-file* as a binary.


<code>#include-files dir file-list</code>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Include the files from the *file-list* looking for them in the given
*dir* directory. The files are included as a block containing name and
the binary contents of all files.


<code>COMMENT</code>
++++++++++++++++++++

Leave out the COMMENT directive and its argument from the code. The
comment is not left out if the *_keep-comments_* global variable is
defined when the directive is processed.


Conditional preprocessing directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


<code>#if cond-block true-block</code>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Conditionally include the given *then-block* if the *cond-block*
evaluates *true*. The *then-block* is preprocessed when included.


<code>#either cond-block true-block false-block</code>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Conditionally include one of the two blocks depending on the result of
evaluation of the given *cond-block*. The block being included is
preprocessed.


Global words used
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


*_include_*
+++++++++++

The *_include_* word refers to the *include* function.


*_include-ctx_*
+++++++++++++++

The *_include-ctx_* word refers to the object containing important
*include* variables and helper functions.


*_script?_*
+++++++++++

The implementation patches the *_script?_* function when needed.


INCLUDE-CTX variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


*_path_*
++++++++

The *_path_* word refers to a block containing the paths where the
*include* function shall look for the files.

If the script file to include is specified with a non-empty path the
script file is looked up only at its path. As opposed to that when the
script file is specified without any path using only a file name
*include* will use the *include-ctx/path* to look for the file.

The *path* can be modified/set by users. See also the *include-ctx/push*
and *include-ctx/pop* helper functions.


Prioritization

The directories (or URLs) that are first in the *include-path* are
searched first. Consequently they are having priority during the file
search.


*_log_*
+++++++

The *_log_* variable refers to a block containing the files (with
complete paths) *include* function processed. It is used by the
<code>/check</code> refinement and by the <code>#include-check</code>
directive to check whether a specific file was already included. The
default REBOL comparison (which is case-insensitive) is used and the
paths are converted to lowercase.

The user can save the *log* to a file to create a log file. The user can
influence what will be considered as "already included", typically by
clearing the contents of the *log* block when starting to link a new
file. The files are appended to the *log* block as they are found by
*include*, which means that the file found last will be the last one in
the log.


*_stack_*
+++++++++

The stack used by the *push* and *pop* helper functions (see below).
There is no need to use the variable directly.


*_block-directive_*
+++++++++++++++++++

Handling a subblock or paren.


*_conditional-directives_*
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The definitions of #if and #either conditional directives.


*_standard-directives_*
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The definitions of the standard directives (all except the block
directive, conditional directives and special includes).


*_special-includes_*
++++++++++++++++++++

The definitions of #include-binary, #include-string and #include-files
directives.


*_directives_*
++++++++++++++

The *_directives_* variable refers to the block containing the
definitions of directives that are currently used by *include*. There is
usually no need to handle this variable directly since
*include-ctx/get-directives*, *include-ctx/set-directives* and
*include-ctx/update-directives* take care of it.


*_standard-header_*
+++++++++++++++++++

The *_standard-header_* variable refers to the script header prototype
object. Defined for compatibility between R2 and R3.


*_file_*
++++++++

The *_file_* variable refers to the file processed by INCLUDE.


INCLUDE-CTX functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


*_include-script_*
++++++++++++++++++

The function used by *include* and by directives to preprocess a script.


*_include-block_*
+++++++++++++++++

The function used by *include-script* and by directives to preprocess a
block or a paren. Generated by the *set-directives* function.


*_get-directives_*
++++++++++++++++++

Refers to a function returning the directives block used by *include*.
The directives block is the block containing the definitions of all
*include* directives.


*_set-directives_*
++++++++++++++++++

Refers to a function setting the directives block used by *include*.


*_update-directives_*
+++++++++++++++++++++

Refers to a function updating the *directives* (not modifying the block,
though) using the given *directives-to-update* block. If a directive
contained in the *directives-to-update* block is already present in the
*directives* block it is updated. Otherwise it is appended as a new
directive.

The usage of the *set-directives* function to update/add new *include*
*directives* is not particularly comfortable. This function should be
used as a more comfortable helper.


*_push_*
++++++++

Sometimes it is desirable to be able to temporarily redefine the
*_include-ctx/path_* while being able to restore its previous value
after some time. The *push* function takes a *new-path* argument storing
the current *_path_* contents to the *stack* and using the given
*new-path* instead.


*_pop_*
+++++++

Restores the previous *path* value from the *stack*. It is the
counterpart of the *push* function. If the *stack* is empty, an error is
triggered.


*_do-next_*
+++++++++++

Do next expression, using the "R3 convention", compatible with R2 and
R3.


*_load-next_*
+++++++++++++

Load the next value, compatible with R2 and R3.


*_read-binary_*
+++++++++++++++

Read a binary value from a source, compatible with R2 and R3.


*_make-error_*
++++++++++++++

Make the error according to the given specifications, compatible with R2
and R3, allows setting the NEAR and WHERE attributes even in R2.


*_disarm-error_*
++++++++++++++++

Disarm the error, compatible with R2 and R3.


*_redo-error_*
++++++++++++++

"enhance" (if needed) and redo the given error.


*_include-error_*
+++++++++++++++++

Create and trigger a new include-type error.


*_split-path_*
++++++++++++++

Splits the given path.


*_findpfile_*
+++++++++++++

Find the given file using the given search path.


*_find-file_*
+++++++++++++

Find a file (using INCLUDE-CTX/PATH if desired).


The INCLUDE error type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new INCLUDE error type is defined, with the following ids:


ENHANCED
++++++++

This error represents an, otherwise "normal" error that occurred during
code preprocessing. The error is "enhanced" to "know" the file in which
it occurred.


FILE-OR-URL-IN-PATH
+++++++++++++++++++

A file or a URL was expected in the PATH.


STACK-EMPTY
+++++++++++

The POP function found the STACK to be empty.


FILE-NOT-FOUND
++++++++++++++

The file to be included was not found.


EXPECTED
++++++++

The directive expected an argument.


INVALID-DIRECTIVE
+++++++++++++++++

The UPDATE-DIRECTIVES function obtained an invalid directive
specification in the DIRECTIVES-TO-UPDATE block.


Usage examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A call equivalent to *prebol* processing <code>%somefile.r</code> and
storing the result of the preprocessing to <code>%outfile.r</code> would
look like:

<pre>include/link %somefile.r %outfile.r</pre>

To change the *include-ctx/path*:

<pre>append include-ctx/path url-or-directory</pre>

The *include* call corresponding to the <code>#include-check</code>
directive is <code>include/check</code>, which preprocesses and runs the
script only if it hasn't done so before:

<pre>include/check %somefile.r</pre>

The distinction between preprocessing directives and "normal" *include*
usage is best described on simple examples:

The first example uses *include*, but not the preprocessing directives:

<pre>REBOL [ File: %script-builder.r ]

create a new "standard" script from the script base::

verbose: false

use a clean LOG::

clear include-ctx/log include/link %script-base.r %standard-script.r

now create a verbose version::

verbose: true clear include-ctx/log include/link %script-base.r
%verbose-script.r</pre>

To create the two versions of the script containing everything they need
to run it is sufficient to do:

<pre>include %script-builder.r</pre>

, which takes care of creating both script versions.

The <code>%script-base.r</code> file can look e.g. as follows:

<pre>REBOL [ File: %script-base.r ]

1.  either [verbose] [debug: :print] [debug: none]
2.  include-check %part1.r
3.  include-check %part2.r

...</pre>


Context encapsulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to encapsulate contexts as follows:

<pre>REBOL [ Title: "my script" ]

make object! [#include %your-script.r] make module! [[module spec goes
here] [#include %his-script.r]]</pre>


User-defined directives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New directives are defined using *set-directives* function or, more
comfortably, using the *update-directives* function, which allows
selective updating of *include directives*. The directives are written
in the parse dialect. Even the standard directives are defined this way;
it is possible to take their definition as an example.

The *directives* block is bound to the *include-block* function context
by the *set-directives* function. Furthermore, the user can bind his
*directives* block to the *include-ctx* context if his directives use
some of the *include-ctx* functions or variables.

The locals of the *include-block* function are:


<code>pos1</code>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the definitions of the standard directives it is being used to hold
the current position in the block (or paren) being included. This
variable can be and frequently is redefined.


<code>pos2</code>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the definitions of the standard directives it is being used to hold
the next position (the position following the currently processed
directive part) in the block (or paren) being included.

This variable can be and frequently is redefined.


<code>value1</code>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the definitions of the standard directives it is being used to hold
the first argument value of the currently processed directive.

This variable can be and frequently is redefined.


<code>value2</code>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the definitions of the standard directives it is being used to hold
the second argument value of the currently processed directive.

This variable can be and frequently is redefined.


<code>value3</code>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the definitions of the standard directives it is being used to hold
the third argument value of the currently processed directive.

This variable can be and frequently is redefined.


The #print directive example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The #print directive is meant as the debug-print directive. It uses
(potentially) the *_debug_* flag to "decide" whether to turn the
directive into a *print* call, or simply leave it out from the code
together with its argument.

Usage:

<pre>#print argument</pre>

If the *_debug_* flag (global) is defined (set) when the #print
directive is being processed the directive is turned into a *print*
call; otherwise it is left out from the code.


The definition of the #print directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<pre>Rebol [ Title: "Debug-print" File: %debug-print.r Author: "Ladislav
Mecir" Date: 21-Oct-2011/15:31:41+2:00 Purpose: \{Defines the #print
directive} Notes: \{ uses the debug flag (global) if the debug flag is
set, #print becomes print otherwise, #print and its argument are left
out } ]

include-ctx/update-directives [ #print set value1 skip ( if value?
'debug [ append linked 'print append/only linked get/any 'value1 ] )
]</pre>


How to's
~~~~~~~~


*Include* and relative paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be compatible with *do* *include* changes the working directory to
that of the script it is processing. Note that relative paths are
relative to the actual working directory, not to the directory that was
actual when such paths were put into the *include-ctx/path* block.

For example if we define:

<pre>include-ctx/path: reduce [%. clean-path %.]</pre>

at the first sight it seems that the two elements in the above
*include-ctx/path* are equivalent, but that is not true. The first one
is a relative path always referring to the current working directory
while the second one refers to the directory that was current when the
*include-ctx/path* was defined.


How to evaluate an expression using a #do directive without including a
value into the script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This directive evaluates an expression and includes its result 2 into
the script:

<pre>#do [1 + 1]</pre>

while this one evaluates the expression as well including nothing:

<pre>#do [1 + 1 []]</pre>


How to write code detecting whether it has been preprocessed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a script is running you may need to find out whether it has been
preprocessed or not. Here is how:

<pre>print either (#do [false]) ["this code wasn't preprocessed"]["this
code was preprocessed"]</pre>


How to write a part of a script that you don't want to be preprocessed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you want a part of the script to remain untouched by the
preprocessor. This is a way how:

<pre>#do [[ ; this part will not be preprocessed prin "part1: " print
either (#do [false]) ["not preprocessed"] ["preprocessed"] ]]

this part will be preprocessed::

prin "part2: " print either (#do [false]) ["not preprocessed"]
["preprocessed"]</pre>


How to write a block you don't want to be preprocessed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the above trick we can do it as follows:

<pre>#do link:[ print mold #include[[ print mold #include]] </pre>


How to write code compatible with both *do* and *include*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The <code>%include.r</code> script may serve as an example of a script
containing the preprocessor directives. Still you may want to write such
a script so that its behaviour is the same whether it has been run by
*do* or *include*.

Combining the tricks from the previous sections:

<pre>do if (#do [false]) [func [a b] [do first b]] #do
; here we can put any code with preprocessor directives ; without worrying whether the user ran the script using DO or INCLUDE: print mold #include_;_etc.[;
here we can put any code with preprocessor directives ; without worrying
whether the user ran the script using DO or INCLUDE: print mold #include
; etc.]</pre>

Another alternative - this time it is a block that remains unprocessed
no matter whether the script is processed by *do* or *include*:

<pre>do either (#do [false])[func [a b] [b/1/1]] [func [a] [:a]] #do
link:[ ; here I can put any code with or without preprocessor directives print mold #include[[
; here I can put any code with or without preprocessor directives print
mold #include]]</pre>


How to create a Windows Explorer association for *include*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a Windows Explorer association so that you can right-click on
a <code>.r</code> file to run it using *include*:

* Download the <code>%include.r</code> script.
* Create a script file including any script

::
  This is an example file (use your own directory paths):

<pre>Rebol [ Title: "Incl.r3" File: %incl.r3 Author: "Ladislav Mecir"
Date: 30-Sep-2011/10:23:03+2:00 Purpose: \{Includes the first argument
file, works with R3} ]

define the INCLUDE function::

do %include.r

---- R3 GUI::

include %/d/ladislav/saphirion/trunk/r3-gui/loader/loader.r3

include the argument script::

include to-rebol-file system/script/args</pre>

* Add a new association for <code>.r</code> files. (Actually, you can
add more associations. For example, I have one called <code>r2</code> to
evaluate the script using *include* and Rebol 2 interpreter and one
called <code>r3</code> to evaluate the script using *include* and the
Rebol 3 interpreter.)


How to add the new association for <code>.r</code> files in Windows XP
or older
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run the Windows Explorer and click on <code>Tools/Options</code> in
menu. Next click on the <code>File Types</code> tab and find the
<code>.r</code> file type associations. Click on the
<code>Advanced</code> button and add a new action. Call the new action
<code>r3</code> and the application associated with the new action may
be e.g.:

<pre>"D:\Rebol\r3.exe" d:\rebol\incl.r3 "%1"</pre>

(Adjust your directory appropriately). Next you can decide whether to
make the <code>r3</code> action default. If you make it default you can
just double-click (or left-click if you set your Explorer for one click
as I did) on a <code>.r</code> file to include it. Otherwise you can
right-click the file in Windows Explorer and pick the <code>r3</code>
action from the quick menu.


How to add a new association for <code>.r</code> files in Windows Vista,
Windows 7 or Windows 8
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Run the <code>regedit.exe</code> program
2.  Find the <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.r</code> key
3.  Examine its <code>(Default)</code> value, should be something like
<code>r_auto_file</code>
4.  Find (or create) the <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\r_auto_file</code> key
5.  Find (or create) the
<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\r_auto_file\shell</code> subkey
6.  Under the <code>shell</code> key find (or create) a new
<code>open</code> subkey and a new <code>r3</code> subkey
7.  Under the <code>open</code> key add a new <code>command</code>
subkey
8.  Change the <code>(Default)</code> value of the <code>command</code>
key to something like <code>"D:\Rebol\rebol.exe" d:\rebol\incl.r
"%1"</code> (do not forget to use your directory paths).
9.  Under the <code>r3</code> key add a new <code>command</code> subkey
10. Change the <code>(Default)</code> value of the <code>command</code>
key to something like <code>"D:\Rebol\r3.exe" d:\rebol\incl.r3
"%1"</code> (do not forget to use your directory paths).

Having added the association for the <code>.r</code> files left-clicking
a <code>.r</code> file will run it in the <code>rebol.exe</code>
interpreter while right-clicking a <code>.r</code> file in the Windows
Explorer you will see new <code>open</code> and <code>r3</code> options,
being able to choose which interpreter you want to start.

In the same way you can define the <code>open</code> association for
<code>.r3</code> files.
