Options
^^^^^^^

*Style/options* specify the optional attributes that can be supplied as
arguments in the GUI dialect block. Each option can specify one or more
valid datatypes. When a GUI block is parsed, any valid options are set
in the face/options and face/facets objects.

This block is very important to users because it defines the usage of
the style to the user.

For example, a BUTTON style allows these options:

`   options: [` +
`       text-body: [string! block!]` +
`       area-color: [tuple!]` +
`       size: [pair!]` +
`       wide: [percent!]` +
`   ]`

Within the GUI dialect, usage might be:

`   button "Example" blue` +
`   button green "Go"` +
`   button "Stop" 100x100 red`

On initialization, each option value will appear within the face/options
object and also within the face/facets object, where it can be used by
the draw block and by the style actor functions.

_Note that the options block is not inherited from a parent style._ This
is done to make it very clear what user options are allowed for the
style.

*Face/options* is an object that holds any optional attributes that were
provided to the face when it was defined. For example, the text label of
a button would be put here.

The names and types of values stored in the face/options object is
defined by the options field of the style. This field is used to parse
and type check the options and then create this face/options object.
</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP> For example:

` button "Submit" submit site-url`

Would create an options object:

` text-body: "Submit"`

Note that face actions are not stored in this options object. They are
parsed separately and stored in the optional face/actions block.

The face/options object can also be used to reset a face back to its
initial value. If a style requires this ability, it should always COPY
its option series values, in order to be able to restore them later.
