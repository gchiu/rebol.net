This is a temporary document for exploring the problem of waiting within
an awake (from another wait).


GUI Uses WAIT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:Event_System#WAIT_function[ WAIT function] is used to wait for
events.

When the GUI is running, events are being processed. This happens when
the VIEW function or the user script calls the DO-EVENTS function, which
is defined as:

` wait system/view/event-port`

In other words, the main program stops at this code, and lets events
drive the system, processed by the various event handlers which perform
the GUI functions.


Recursion (Nesting) Situation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, what happens when a function called within the GUI must wait?
For example, if a button is used to READ a web page and then show it,
what happens?

Let's take this example:

`  view [` +
`      button "Read" do [set-face sf read `http://www.rebol.com[`http://www.rebol.com`]`]` +
`      sf: area` +
`      button "Quit" quit` +
`  ]`

This code is somewhat problematic. The reason is:

1.  We synchronously want to perform the read, get the result, and set
the area with the page contents.
2.  We asynchronously want the user to be able to press the Quit button
at any time to close the window.

These are opposing requirements, because we cannot satisfy both at the
same time.


Solution for Requestors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course, we have this problem within the GUI itself, but use a simple
method to solve it.

Consider this code:

`   view [` +
`       button "Ask" do [alert "You have been asked."]` +
`       button "Quit" quit` +
`   ]`

When the Ask button is clicked, the alert window will open, but _it is a
modal window and events to other GUI windows will be ignored_.

The problem is solved by "going modal" for the duration of the alert
window. Events to the main window cannot occur.


The Problem with READ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, this is not the case for the READ above, which internally
operates asynchronously and will call the WAIT function itself, to wait
for the network to respond.

We can represent it this way:

`   WAIT for GUI` +
`      [awake on GUI event for button]` +
`      WAIT for HTTP` +
`          [awake on tcp]` +
`          process HTTP` +
`      WAKE makes WAIT return` +
`      [next GUI event]` +
`      ...`

The second WAIT is occurring during the first WAIT.

But, depending on the network and servers, the WAIT in HTTP can take a
few seconds. If the user clicks on the "Read" button a few times for
HTTP finishes, this will happen:

`   WAIT for GUI` +
`      [awake on button]` +
`      WAIT for HTTP` +
`          [awake on button]` +
`          WAIT for HTTP` +
`              [awake on button]` +
`              WAIT for HTTP` +
`                  [awake on ...]`

So, the code is now nested within three WAITs.

In order for this to actually work, two basic requirements would need to
be properly implemented:

1.  *All code and data would need to be re-entrant.* For example, the
GUI style code that implements the button click processing, etc.
Although for the functional code, this is normally true, there are
exceptions because faces use objects to hold their state, which is a
problem.
2.  *Events would need some way to force WAIT to awake*, even on ports
it's not waiting on. However, that's a violation of the design rules for
WAIT, so we cannot allow that.


Can Multitasking Fix It?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the first things programmers like to do is ask if a problem like
this would be fixed by using multitasking.

Generally, the answer is no. In fact, tasking makes the situation even
more complicated because it requires the use of WAIT even more
frequently (with events, signals, semaphores) within your GUI event
handlers.

It should be noted that this issue is in general is a common problem in
GUI's because single-threaded operation is preferable to the overhead of
granular mutual exclusion protection for all objects of the GUI.

I believe it is the reason why even to this day (2008) your web browser
GUI will sometimes hang, and you must abort the task to clear it.


Reexamining Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When forced with a situation like this, it's good to examine our
requirements again.

1.  *For simple GUI scripts, we would normally want READ to be not only
synchronous, but also modal with respect to the GUI*. That would mean
that events would be ignored while the READ proceeded.
2.  *For advanced reblet applications, we would want a central top-level
event handler* to account for all IO READ operations with the GUI only
initiating specific IO actions, but with the primary AWAKE servicing
their results. WAIT would be called only once.

The first case is like the use of modal requestors, such as the alert
shown above.

This second case is more like a general event handler loop, as often
used in programming environments.


Another Case: Timers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's another case of WAIT in WAIT to think about.

Some buttons periodically repeat. For example, clicking in the bar or
the arrow buttons on a scroll bar.

Often a programmer would be tempted to write code such as:

`   arrow-button do [` +
`       while [button-down][` +
`           bump knob` +
`           wait .1` +
`       ]        ` +
`   ]`

To the user, this code seems to work ok because the mouse is sitting in
a single spot and with buttons in a single state (holding the button
down).

But, consider what may really be going on:

`   WAIT for GUI` +
`       [awake on arrow button down]` +
`       WAIT .1` +
`           [wake on move in arrow button]` +
`           does something, perhaps ON-OVER` +
`       WAIT (.1 - time used)` +
`           [awake on timeout]` +
`           bump knob` +
`       WAIT .1` +
`           ...`

So, this is another case where WAIT is nesting. It tends not to be a
problem because the range of possible events is limited.


Possible Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


For Timers
^^^^^^^^^^

For things like timers, there is a possible solution that should work
well and be fairly easy to implement.

In general, allow *link:Event_System#Event_Datatype[events] to be
written back to the event-port with a time value specified*.

This would be done by creating an object with whatever required state
may be needed, then writing it to the event port, along with a timer
value. After that time period, the event port would awake with that
event.

It could look something like this:

`  my-event: make event! [` +
`      type: 'custom` +
`      window: window-gob (or none)` +
`      data: context [` +
`          timer: 0.1` +
`          field1: 123` +
`          etc.` +
`      ]` +
`  ]` +
`  write event-port my-event`

Then the event would be processed at a low level in the GUI event
handler functions, calling the higher level style actors as needed. For
example, in a scroller style, an on-repeat actor could be called.


For Async IO
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For actions like READ from HTTP, perhaps a general solution would be to
make the DO reactor (and perhaps others) a modal action. That is, while
DO is being processed, other events would be ignored, with perhaps a few
special events such as quit being allowed.
