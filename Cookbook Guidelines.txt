Adding a Cookbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you'll need to initiate a new DocBase page. The easiest way is to
type your preferred page title into the Search field of the DocBase
Navigation section and press Go.

While not totally necessary, cookbooks should start with the
<nowiki></nowiki> template. This template accepts 4 parameters. A
*title*, an *author*, a difficulty *level* and a *category*.

* title does not need to be the same as the page title. Use something
short and snappy. If not included a generic *REBOL Recipe* will be used.
* author would be what ever credit you would like. If not included
*Incognito* will be used.
* level is a number from 1 to 3. 1 matches _Beginner_, 2 for
_Intermediate_ and 3 for 'Advanced''. 2 is default.
* category should be Tip, Code, Networking, Data Processing etcetera.
Defaults to *Code*.
