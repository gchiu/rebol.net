*For keeping track of changes to development of host kit.*

For released versions, see: http://www.rebol.com/r3/changes.html["R3
change log"]


For A105 (Planned)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bootstrap check for DLL version and struct alignment with decent error
messages.

Merge the module-related changes back into the release. This will
require substantial testing by all developers due to implementation
changes in LOAD, DO, MODULE, IMPORT, and more. Many thanks to BrianH.


For A104 (Released)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only one change is planned: combine the host-lib with the ext-lib
allowing a single pointer to access both function APIs from either the
host or from extensions. The host-lib version compatibility validation
test will be used for both host and extension.

This change can be accomplished by padding the host-lib with reserved
function slots for future expansion, but with no performance overhead.


For A103 (Released)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds *link:External_Callbacks[External Callbacks]*.
* Added to reb-ext-lib.h for use in C++ includes (from RMA:Robert):

`#ifdef __cplusplus` +
`#define extern "C" RXIEXT __declspec(dllexport)` +
`#else` +
`#define RXIEXT __declspec(dllexport)` +
`#endif //__cplusplus`

* Adds decoder codec for markup conversion (HTML, XML, etc.) to blocks.
Use: <tt>decode 'markup binary</tt>
* Fix for pair set path decimal (bad conversion: <tt>a: 0x0 a/x:
1.0</tt>).
* Internal changes to graphics series storage method. Makes storage more
efficient. Should not affect extensions code that uses proper API
functions. Also, if we want to allow various alpha controls for images
overall, this needs to be defined.
