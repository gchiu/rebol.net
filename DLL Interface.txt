R3 DLL Interface Open Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of topics we need to consider, decide on, work out further


Where to put the main DLL interface?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Option 1: Rebol Dialect
+++++++++++++++++++++++

It's all in REBOL code, just like it's done today in R2 (as a dialect
that can interface with the DLL) with some enhancements to make life
easier.

Pros: It's like R2, so you already know it. The code can all be seen at
the REBOL code level (nothing hidden below).::

Cons: Has limitations regarding parts of the OS environment that are
difficult to access via REBOL code, and it's not as fast as native
code.::


Option 2: Host-Lib
++++++++++++++++++

It's all in C code, and it defines its own native functions used in
REBOL.

Pros: The host level is written in C code and begins at the main program
entry point. This allows full control over the environment, including
window handles, threads, mutex, events, and other parts of the OS API
(that are often not accessible via REBOL code directly).::

Cons: Requires expert-level coding practices and debugging can be
difficult. All of the code is hidden from the REBOL level except the
native function names themselves. The natives are statically created
(during host compile time), not dynamically.::


Option 3: Hybrid Model
++++++++++++++++++++++

Robert: I see Option 1 like the R2 interface today. You create a DLL,
export some functions, write the C level interface spec in Rebol.

Option 2 is bringing your DLL into host-lib context (statically linked
or dynamically loaded), maybe you add some helper functions to the DLL
to call Rebol code etc.

Option 3: Is a mix of both. You control the DLL integration from Rebol
(for people like Petr) and include the DLL into the host-lib context.
Option 2 is a C-level only approach, Rebol gets what's defined in the
host-lib. Option 3 makes it possible to tweak this a bit from Rebol side
using something like Gregg's DLL dialect.

A way to specify some interface hints, interfaces, where to bring in
function names in Rebol and a simple way to include a DLL into the host.

Pros:::

Cons:::


Option 4: Plug-In Model
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Similar to option 2, except that a REBOL script loads a plugin (which is
a DLL that conforms to the REBOL plug-in standard). The plugin then
defines natives, mezzanines, and data and can load other DLLs as part of
its initialization.

Pros: Provides a standard plugin model with C-level access to external
DLLs and the OS API and environment (like option 1). Also allows dynamic
adding of native functions into REBOL.::

Cons: Requires that a plugin be made for any external DLL that is
needed. Less flexible than option 1 (because C code must be compiled),
but more flexible than option 2 (because it is dynamic).::

It may be possible to write a "generalized" plugin method that can
handle all external DLLs, but it would require a method to identify or
input the function specifications for each DLL interface. This
specification could be a simple declarative dialect if we carefully
limit its capabilities to only handle simple C-like APIs, as with R2 -
as long as we have the full plugin model to fall back on. This
generalized plugin would be equivalent to option 1.

It could also be possible to write plugins for different particular
programming platforms that use the discovery and/or reflection
capabilities specific to the platform. On Windows this would mean
plugins for .NET, Java, ActiveX/COM, and maybe C++ or Delphi. These
plugins could be community projects.


How to handle DLL callbacks?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support for mutlithreaded DLLs
* Number and frequence of callbacks
* How to deal with structure pointers as callback results? How to bring
the pointed structure into Rebol?
* Is using a queue which gets polled to collect results better?
* Transfer results via sockets to enable network-transmitted callbacks?


How to handle resource allocations?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The problem is: Everyone does it differently. Someone using the
interface has to understand who cares about allocated resources when
using and linking a DLL.

Nevertheless, we should be possible to support all kind of patterns:

1.  DLL does it all (Rebol needs to make a copy to be sure to have
control over the data)
2.  DLL doesn't do it (then Rebol should take over control and the GC
must be able to deallocate stuff and this event needs a way into the DLL
to execute some housekeeping functions)


Things to take care about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* There is a constant stream of data moving through the event system and
the WAIT function. This includes high precision timers for keeping
timing accurate. How to avoid that a DLL causes problems in this flow?

* Synchron and asynchron DLL functions. Async could be done via Devices.
Devices use a standard API entry (like main for a C program) and use
event-driven results.

* How to make the interface crash-proof? What happens if a DLL goes
wild? Can we protect the rest of Rebol from it?

* There can be a lot of different concepts used inside the DLL code. We
want to be able to ~link~ with external binary code. We need to be able
to deal with all these variants in an elegant way.

* Used datastructures in DLLs: A way to traverse DLL datastructures or
serialize them for Rebol.

* No requirment to write wrapper code for DLLs or provide specific
interfaces. The more requirements exists, the more complicated will it
be to make DLLs available to Rebol scripts.

* Create an interface (maybe this is not directly DLL related) so that
Rebol can be used to create plug-ins for applications like iPhot,
Filemanager, ...

* Add support for interfaces that use special type castings as
indication for special situations. Example: char* or NULL. Sending a
char* to an empty string won't work here (the pointer is not zero in
this case) instead a zero-pointer is required. Maybe it's a good idea to
add a zero-pointer constant to Rebol that is of type any-type!


R2 DLL Interface Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a collection of feedback, ideas and proposals based on the R2
DLL interface. It will help us to get an overview of problems, quirks
etc. to finally design a good R3 DLL interface

I (Ladislav) support the variant 1, i.e. the variant based on REBOL
dialect, a.k.a. improved R2 DLL interface. Reason: this is the way how
to "drink our own wine", helping REBOL popularity, although it may not
be the way offering the highest speed.


Structs are for interfacing with C
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Therefore, I think, that a definition like:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ number [integer!] character [char!] ]
none</pre>

is actually an error. What is needed, is to be able to define structs
containing C datatypes, like:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ a-32-bit-integer [int] a-64-bit-integer
[I64] a-float [float] a-double [double] a-character [char] ] none</pre>

This change will make the interface less confusing, especially for
newcomers.


Nested structs aren't pointers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In C, it is possible to nest structs. This means, that it is possible to
write something like:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ innner-struct [struct! [i [int] c [char]]]
] none</pre>

having essentially the same meaning as:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ i [int] c [char] ] none</pre>

with the exception, that in the former case the items are seen as
"grouped together", even though they occupy exactly the same places in
the resulting structure.

As opposed to that, the current (R2) behaviour is, that the former case
is interpreted as a struct containing a pointer to struct, which should
have been rather described as:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ innner-struct [struct*! [i [int] c
[char]]] ] none</pre>


Structs can be returned from C
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This means, that we should be able to write:

<pre>ret-struct: make routine! [ return: [struct! [x [float] y [float]]]
] lib "ret_struct"</pre>

Meaning, that the ret_struct function returns a structure, not a pointer
to structure. Currently, there is no way how to circumvent this problem.

When expecting a pointer to structure, we should write:

<pre>ret-struct: make routine! [ return: [struct*! [a [int] b [float]]]
] lib "ret_struct"</pre>


Fixed length arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In C it is possible to define fixed length arrays in a structure. I
suggest to support that using a syntax:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ ca [char [10]] ] none</pre>

Note: This is not the same as the current behaviour of the char-array
construct in R2. Char-array actually inserts into the structure just a
pointer, i.e. the current R2 construct:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ ca [char-array 10] ] none</pre>

Actually corresponds to the declaration below, which I propose as a more
adequate replacement, having greater flexibility:

<pre>a-struct: make struct! [ ca [struct*! [char [10]]] ] none</pre>


C pointers
^^^^^^^^^^

I propose to use a new struct*! datatype to represent C pointers, i.e.
to represent a C pointer like:

<pre>void *p;</pre>

I suggest to use the syntax:

<pre>p [struct*!]</pre>

The same holds for

<pre>char *ptr;</pre>

, which may be represented by

<pre>ptr [struct*! [c [char]]]</pre>

To be as user-friendly as possible we need to allow for struct*!
conversions like:

<pre>to string! ptr ; converts char* to REBOL string using the
nul-character convention bp: to #[struct*! [char [10]]] p ; converts
void *p to a pointer to array of 10 characters to binary! bp ; converts
the pointer to REBOL binary! having length (10) op: to #[struct*! [x
[float] y [float]]] p ; converts p to a pointer to a structure
containing two floats</pre>


Existing code

the situation in R2.
