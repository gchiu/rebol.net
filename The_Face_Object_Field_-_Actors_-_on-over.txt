*on-over* is invoked every time the mouse moves over or away from the
face and is not performing dragging.

If the face has the ALL-OVER value specified as TRUE, this actor will be
run continuously as long as the mouse is over the face. If ALL-OVER is
FALSE (default), it does not report continuously, when over the face,
but only on enter and exit.

As standard, the on-over sets the face/state/mode to 'over or 'up and
then draws the face. This is useful, during
*link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-draw[on-draw]* to set a face
appearance on face/state/mode.

An input argument would be the offset or NONE.

A return value is not necessary.

It is invoked just after the
*link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-move[on-move]* event.
