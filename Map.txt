This document describes the new map datatype.


Overview
~~~~~~~~

A map is a key-to-value associative array. It uses hashing for high
performance. Sometimes this kind of association is also referred to as a
dictionary.

The map datatype replaces the R2 hash datatype. The motivation for this
replacement was that some people in the user community felt the design
of the older hash datatype was confusing, since it hashed both keys and
their data. The new map datatype just hashes keys. Data is not hashed.


Keys
~~~~

The map datatype lets you attach _keys_ to data values. It is more
efficient than a block or object (when words as keys are unbound) once
you have more than a couple dozen keys.

A key can be any type of word or string. Other datatypes are not allowed
at this time.

Note that when a string is used for a key:

* the dataype of the string is also part of the key. For example, the
string "test" is not the same as the file name %test or the issue #test.
* the string is copied into the map. It is not by reference. This
prevents the problem where a string is modified after the association
has been made.

Map allows integers as keys. They are not indexes.

`   >> m: make map! [x a 1 b 2 c 3 y]` +
`   == make map! [x a 1 b 2 c 3 y]` +
`   >> m/2` +
`   == c`


Values
~~~~~~

The value associated with a key can be any datatype. For example, you
can associate a key that happens to be a word with a file name, a block,
an object, or even a graphics object.

Note that series and other complex datatype values are stored by
reference. That means that they can be modified outside of the map
structure.


Actions
~~~~~~~

You can access a map using paths or action functions.

The paths allowed are:

* dict/word - get a value for that key (or return NONE if no such word)
* dict/word: - set a value for that key, or creating it if necessary

These action functions are currently supported:

* make
* to
* pick
* select (same as pick)
* poke
* length
* equal?
* not-equal?
* append
* insert (same as append)

In addition TO-BLOCK, TO-OBJECT, FORM and MOLD will work for map types.


General Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General usage has been kept very simple -- to be on par (or better) with
what other scripting languages offer.

Here is an example that shows the most common usage patterns:

<pre> d: make map! 1000

`   d/test: 10` +
`   print d/test` +
`   10`

`   print d/notest` +
`   none`

`   d/test: 20` +
`   print d/test` +
`   20` `</pre>`

The above example shows that you can directly create new map keys and
values.

Also, you can see that if a key is not defined in the map, a NONE value
is returned.

The PICK and POKE series functions also allow access to the map:

`   poke d 'test 100` +
`   print pick d 'test` +
`   100`

PICK and POKE are also necessary when strings are used as keys:

`   poke d "text" [1 2 3 4]` +
`   poke d %file 1234` +
`   print pick d "text"` +
`   1 2 3 4` +
`   print pick d %file` +
`   1234` +
`   print pick d "file"` +
`   none`

That last case is used to show that the datatype of strings is part of
the key when using maps.

Note that instead of PICK and POKE it's also possible to use path
evaluation:

`   key: "id"` +
`   d/(key): 5678` +
`   print d/(key)` +
`   5678` +
`   key: 'id` +
`   d/(key): 9` +
`   print d/id` +
`   9`

`   keys: [name job]` +
`   d/(keys/1): "Carl"` +
`   d/(keys/2): "Guru"` +
`   print reduce [d/name "is" d/job]` +
`   Carl is Guru`


Make Map
~~~~~~~~

You can make a map with:

`  d: make map! 1000`

or with:

`  d1: make map! [a: 10 b: 20 c: 30]`

and, the word values do not need to be set-words. This also works:

`  d2: make map! [a 10 b 20 c 30]`

In fact, REBOL will always preserve the datatype of the word, so if you
MOLD d1 you will see:

`  make map! [a: 10 b: 20 c: 30]`

But, d2 will give you:

`  make map! [a 10 b 20 c 30]`


Notes
~~~~~

1.  Dictionaries auto-expand as needed. Once the hash table hits certain
sizes, it also expands to keep hash key lookup fast.
2.  A map only becomes hashed after 16 keys are defined. This is done to
keep very small dictionaries small with fast access.
3.  Keys are never removed from a map, for now. However, you can set a
key to NONE if you no longer need it. The key will no longer appear when
the map is formed or molded, and will not be included when the map is
converted to a block or object. This is effectively the same thing as
removing the key, except it still takes space in the map, for now.
4.  Dictionaries can not be used as series at this time (we may decide
to add that later, but the concepts don't match). However, you can use
TO-BLOCK to convert a map to a block series.
5.  Keys are not case sensitive (but, should there be a mode to allow
that?)
6.  Currently, there is a maximum limit of about 500000 entries in a
map. We can expand this limit if we think it's needed.
