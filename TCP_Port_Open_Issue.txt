The purpose of this technical note is to describe how OPEN works for TCP
ports (so if there is a problem with this method, we can address and
correct it very soon -- before we have a few protocols running with it).


Quick Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a quick review, recall these facts:

* TCP connections are made with IP addresses, not with host names.
* REBOL TCP port specifications (e.g. URLs) allow host names, as well as
IP addresses.

*What this means is that in REBOL the TCP OPEN action does an extra
step.* It does a DNS lookup if a host is given.

In R3, *that is a small problem because the state machine has been
cleaned up and simplified compared to R2*.


The Connection Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, here is how the sequence for OPEN now works in R3. (Keep in mind
that this is all asynchronous.)

1.  OPEN port (where port is a spec or an existing port object).
2.  If the IP address is not known, the port issues a LOOKUP to the TCP
device. (See note A below)
3.  When the IP address is found, the AWAKE handler gets a LOOKUP event.
4.  OPEN port (a second time, see note B below).
5.  The IP address is known, so the port issues a CONNECT to the TCP
device.
6.  When the connection is made, the AWAKE handler gets a CONNECT event.
7.  Your code can then issue a WRITE and begin communicating.


Notes
~~~~~

Note A: The TCP device itself does the lookup. The DNS device is not
used. The reason is to avoid a conflict with a single request object
being used at the same time with two separate devices. Although, it
would probably be ok to do that, it could create issues when the request
is queued (pending), because the request would not be found in the TCP
device queue, but in the DNS device queue. I decided it would be best to
avoid that situation.::

Note B: OPEN is called twice. *It is moded.* The mode is determined by
the existence of the IP address. If the IP address is not known, the
LOOKUP happens, otherwise the CONNECT happens. This also means that if
you do an OPEN of a port where you provide the IP address, no lookup is
done; you skip directly to CONNECT. If it is necessary to determine if
the IP address is known (a rare situation), use QUERY -- which can be
called at any time and is very fast.::

Additional Note: The benefit of receiving the LOOKUP event in the awake
handler should be stated. First, it allows you to easily apply IP
filters (such as deny or redirect) within a TCP handler. Second, it
keeps the state machine simple, because there is no hidden state that
you cannot detect in your code.::

Device Changes: Because the LOOKUP is "out of band" with regard to the
normal read/write activities of the TCP device, a special command,
LOOKUP, has been added to the device driver interface. (This is similar
to the CREATE, DELETE, and RENAME special commands needed for things
like directory IO.) This command may also be of use in other devices,
but _it should not be confused_ with the usage of READ such as that done
for the file directory device -- where the READ specifies the directory
path (and file name pattern) of the file list to return.::


Example
~~~~~~~

Here is an example of a minimal raw TCP case that makes an HTTP request
(without the HTTP scheme of course) and prints the result.

The AWAKE handler code shows the lookup and other states. Note that the
handler itself requests the next state. The state machine is not built
into the port or device C code, so you can manage the state at the
lowest levels.

<pre> http-request: \{GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.rebol.net

}

wp: make port! tcp://www.rebol.net

wp/awake: func [event /local port] [ port: event/port print
["==TCP-event:" event/type] switch/default event/type [ read [print
["^\read:" length? port/data] read port] wrote [read port] lookup [print
query port open port] connect [write port http-request] ][true] ]

open wp wait [wp 3] print wp/data close wp </pre>

Here, the event handler actions in the switch are listed according to
frequency (although it won't make much difference in speed -- just a
habit.)

Note, to keep the example simple, the HTTP result header is not
processed (so we don't know the correct length). The WAIT just times out
after three seconds and returns.
