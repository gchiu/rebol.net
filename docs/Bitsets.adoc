*This page describes the BITSET! datatype as defined in R3.*

Note: these changes apply to the next alpha release, not the current
version.


Major Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various changes have been made to the BITSET! datatype. Here is a quick
summary:

* Supports Unicode characters and strings.
* Bitsets are variable length for all cases (even when used for
charsets).
* New datatype action functions and features are supported.
* Bit order of binary representation has changed.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The official documentation for bitsets can be found here:
http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/bitset.html[Bitset Datatype]

It is being revised and updated. If you see missing information, please
add it.


Unicode Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you would expect, *bitsets now support Unicode*.

This means that both CHAR! and STRING! values used with bitsets will use
the Unicode code-point value for the bit number.

Note that Unicode code-point values can be much larger than 8 bits, and
this can effect the size of your bitset. For example, if you create a
bitset that includes Unicode characters up to 800, then the bitset will
require 100 bytes of storage.

Note: In general practice, this should not be a problem because we don't
expect a large number of large bitsets to be defined in most
applications. That's why we do not use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array[sparse arrays] for storage. In
addition sparse arrays add structural and computational overhead.


Variable Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have always been able to define bitsets of any reasonable length,
but now the length is more automatic:

* Bitsets are only as long as needed.
* Virtual bits outside physical range are valid.
* Bitsets will auto expand if necessary.

For example, in R2 if you created a bitset:

`  bits: make bitset! 160`

a 160 bit set would be created. However, if you wrote:

`  space: make bitset! " ^-^/"`

a 256 bitset would be created (because it assumed you wanted an 8-bit
character-based bitset).

*In R3, this is no longer true. A bitset is only as long as needed to
hold its maximum bit value.* The line:

`  space: make bitset! " ^-^/"`

creates a 40 bit set that looks like this:

`  make bitset! #{0060000080}`

The bitset is only as long as it needs to be.

If you check for a bit outside its range, such a request is valid:

`  if find space "a" [print "found"]`

In R2, this line would have caused an error, but it is fine in R3. All
virtual bits are zero.

In addition, a bitset will auto-extend as needed. For example:

`  append space ".:;"`

will expand the space bitset to be:

`  make bitset! #{006000008002}`

Again, it is only as long as needed to hold the largest bit.

The above examples show only string bit values, but these rules apply to
bitsets that are accessed with CHAR! and INTEGER! bit values as well.


Bitset Datatype Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These actions are defined:

* MAKE, TO - creates new bitsets
* COPY - copies the bitset
* FIND, PICK - test bit values
* COMPLEMENT, NEGATE - invert bit values
* APPEND, INSERT, POKE - set bit values
* REMOVE - clears specific bit values
* CLEAR - clears all bit values
* LENGTH? - returns the number of bits
* AND, OR, XOR - perform bitwise logic operations (and return new
result)

In addition, SAME?, EQUAL?, and NOT-EQUAL? work for bitsets.

The ZERO? action always returns FALSE. (But should it return TRUE if no
bits are set?)

Notes:

1.  APPEND, INSERT, POKE will expand bitset if needed.
2.  FIND is TRUE if it matches ANY of the bit values.
3.  REMOVE requires /PART to specify the target of the removal action.
4.  INTERSECT does the same thing as AND.
5.  UNION does the same thing as OR.


Bitset Specs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the series access functions above allow the bits in a bitset to
be specified with:

* CHAR! - such as #" "
* INTEGER! - such as 123
* STRING! - such as "abc"
* BINARY! - only for MAKE and TO
* BLOCK! - for combinations

A block allows multiple bits to be specified using integers, chars, and
strings. For example:

`  bits: make bitset! [#"-" #"a" - #"z" "!@#$" 201 - 220]`

Note that characters and integers can specify inclusive ranges.

Other examples:

`  append bits "ABC"` +
`  append bits [#"A" - #"Z"]` +
`  find bits "abc"` +
`  find bits [#"C" - #"X"]` +
`  remove/part bits "abc"` +
`  remove/part bits [#"a" - #"z"]`


Bitset Binary Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The binary representation for bitsets has changed. It is now
left-to-right bit continuous (as if bits were written in binary).

For example, in R3:

` >> make bitset! "abcd"` +
` == make bitset! #{00000000000000000000000078}`

but, in R2:

` >> make bitset! "abcd"` +
` == make bitset! #{` +
` 0000000000000000000000001E00000000000000000000000000000000000000` +
` }`

This change is not a requirement, so let Carl immediately if you think
it may cause an important incompatibility.


Possible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are any other possible features that you need for bitsets,
please note them here (and use 4 ~ chars to indicate your name/date).

* FIND will return TRUE if ANY char is listed. Do we want PICK to
require ALL chars listed, or it could be a refinement of FIND such as
FIND/ALL (or reverse logic FIND/ANY). -User:Carl[Carl] 01:22, 16 January

* Make sure we can INSERT (APPEND, POKE) a bitset into a bitset, for an
in-place UNION. -User:BrianH[BrianH] 14:35, 16 January 2008 (EST)

* Make sure we can REMOVE/PART a bitset from a bitset, for an in-place
INTERSECT. -User:BrianH[BrianH] 14:35, 16 January 2008 (EST)

* I'm asking if we could use the 'third func on a bitset to get a
pointer on the binary serie (like for struct!).

It could limit the memory overhead when using to-binary bitset! or
to-bitset binary!. User:Steeve[Steeve] 09:10, 17 January 2008 (EST)

* Bitsets can be used to store a list of positive integers too (we can
see them like a list of index)

Index: make bitset! 65536

insert Index 250

insert Index 8000

insert Index 0

Each integer take only one bit in the bitset. It's a very good solution
to store huge list of integers.

In a block each integer take 16 bytes (correct me if i'm wrong). So, to
distinguish if we must use a bitset in replacement of a block, we can do
this calcul

V = value of the biggest integer. N = Number of integers.

If the equation V/8
