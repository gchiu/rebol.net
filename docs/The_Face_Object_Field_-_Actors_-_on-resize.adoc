*on-resize* is invoked, every time the layout is resized by the layout
engine. Set the dimensions for the draw block as well as the size of the
face GOB in this actor.

The input argument is the new size of the face as a pair!.

No return value is necessary.

If your style is a compound style, the faces inside may also need to be
resized, which is done with the RESIZE-PANEL function.
