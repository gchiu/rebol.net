List of equality operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EQUAL?, EQUIV?, STRICT-EQUAL?, and SAME? (proposed by BrianH as his list
#2).


General principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Domain
^^^^^^

To be comparable, all equality operators shall have the same domain,
which means, that every test of the form:

equal? error? try [equal? :a :b] error? try [compare :a :b]

has to succeed (= yield TRUE).

One of the simplest alternatives is, that the domain of every equality
operator will consist of all REBOL values except for #[unset!]. In that
case every test of the form:

not all [ value? 'a value? 'b error? try [compare :a :b] ]

has to succeed.


Relational
^^^^^^^^^^

The equality operators are relational operators, i.e. they should yield
a LOGIC! type value whenever the argument values are in the domain of
the respective operator (i.e. whenever the operator evaluation doesn't
cause error). This means, that every test of the form:

any [ error? try [compare :a :b] logic? compare :a :b ]

has to succeed (= yield TRUE) either because the arguments are "out of
the domain", or because the result is of the LOGIC! type.


Reflexivity
^^^^^^^^^^^

Every equality operator shall be reflexive. That means, that every test
of the form:

any [ error? try [compare :a :a] compare :a :a ]

has to succeed (= yield TRUE), either because A is "out of the domain",
or because the comparison operator shall be reflexive in its domain.


Symmetry
^^^^^^^^

Every equality operator shall be symmetric. That means, that every test
of the form:

any [ error? try [compare :a :b] equal? compare :a :b compare :b :a
]

has to succeed.


Transitivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Except for the EQUAL? operator, which is expected to test for
approximate equality of decimal, percent and date values, every equality
operator shall be transitive. That means, that every test of the form:

any [ error? try [compare :a :b] not compare :a :b error? try
[compare :b :c] not compare :b :c compare :a :c ]

has to succeed.


Hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^

The equality operators are ordered by their fineness, the order is:
EQUAL?, EQUIV?, STRICT-EQUAL?, SAME?, where EQUAL? is the coarsest, and
SAME? the finest equality operator.

The hierarchy requirement can be expressed as the requirement, that
every test having one of the forms:

; EQUIV? is finer than EQUAL? any [ error? try [equal? :a :b] not
equiv? :a :b equal? :a :b ]

; STRICT-EQUAL? is finer than EQUIV? any [ error? try [equal? :a
:b] not strict-equal? :a :b equiv? :a :b ]

; SAME? is finer than STRICT-EQUAL? any [ error? try [equal? :a :b]
not same? :a :b strict-equal? :a :b ]
