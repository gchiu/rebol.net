Traditionally, languages operate on the concept of names and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(programming)[scopes] which are
rigidly enforced by the constructs of the language. Rebol has a more
flexible architecture that allows you to build your own scoping rules
and constructs.

Default scoping behavior in Rebol is geared toward memory and execution
efficiency. This choice has historically led some to the incorrect
conclusion that everything in Rebol is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable[global variable]. What _is_
true is that to begin to understand scoping in Rebol, it is essential to
have a grasp on how reading and writing "variables" is fundamentally
different.


SET-WORD! vs Traditional Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assigning a variable in most languages involves something like:

 foo = 10; 

This is generally parsed into an abstract syntax tree as three elements.
Those are:

* The assignment operation (=)
** Its left hand argument (the variable to assign to)
** Its right hand argument (the quantity to give it)

Some languages require you to declare the variable in advance of
assigning a value to it, while others do not. But it is always
understood that the presence of such a statement in a codebase implies
that there is (or will be) a variable called "foo" with associated
memory allocated for it.

A typical assignment in Rebol looks deceptively similar:

 foo: 10 

But let us do a careful study of what _actually_ happens during an
assignment.

 ; When you first start the interpreter, Foo has no value

>> foo

* ** Script error: foo has no value

`   ; Create a block containing code that will assign 10 to Foo when it is run`

>> code: [foo: 10] == ...

`   ; Though Code has a value now, we haven't run it (thus no value for Foo...yet)`

>> foo

* ** Script error: foo has no value

`   ; How many items are in the Code block?`

>> length? code == 2

`   ; That's only two.  The first is of type SET-WORD!`

>> type? first code == set-word!

`   ; The second is of type INTEGER!`

>> type? second code == integer!

`   ; Now let us DO the Code`

>> do code == ...

`   ; Foo now evaluates to the quantity 10`

>> foo == 10 

SET-WORD! is an abstract symbol type, that the parser ascribes to any
legal word identifier which has a colon at the end. While the DO dialect
has chosen to interpret a SET-WORD! followed by an expression as an
assignment, other dialects can ascribe arbitrary meaning to such tokens.

As a fairly realistic example, if you were making a dialect for people
writing plays it might be natural to use SET-WORD! for characters in
lines of dialogue...

 dialogue: [ Polonius: "What is the matter, my lord?" Hamlet:
"Between who?" Polonius: "I mean, the matter that you read, my lord."
Hamlet: \{Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging
thick amber and plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir, though I most
powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it
thus set down, for yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.} Polonius: ("Aside") "Though this be madness, yet
there is method in't." ] 

Although this block contains SET-WORD! elements, if you refrain from
using DO on it then you can handle them however you like. To get a list
of unique characters in the above dialogue, we can use COLLECT-WORDS:

 >> collect-words/set dialogue == [Polonius Hamlet] 

Clearly this is not something that represents a series of assignments.
So merely entering a SET-WORD! in the source does not allocate memory
for a "Hamlet" variable or a "Polonious" variable. We must look at the
context in which an expression appears to know its semantics, and that
applies equally to all Rebol constructs.

Yet still, the DO dialect was able to set and retrieve a value for Foo
in the earlier example. If Rebol doesn't have "variables" per se, then
how was this achieved?


Words in Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is runtime notion of a "context" which is simply understood as an
object which maps from words to values. Every word can be bound to at
most one contextual object...and it is possible to programmatically
unbind and rebind a word into any context you like.

A simple example can demonstrate the principle in action.

 ; Assign "foo" to the someWord in the global context

>> someWord: "foo" == "foo"

`   ; Make a context called scopeA in which someWord is mapped to "bar"`

>> scopeBar: object [someWord: "bar"] == ...

`    ; Make a context called scopeMumble in which someWord is mapped to "mumble"` +
`    ; Also map PRINT to a function that reverses its argument`

>> scopeMumble: object [ someWord: "mumble" print: func [str] [reverse
str] ] == ...

`   ; Create some code to print out the value that someWord is mapped to`

>> code: [print someWord] == [print someWord]

`   ; Run the code, and by default we will fetch from the global context`

>> do code foo

`   ; Rebind the words in the code block to scopeBar.` +
`   ; (print is not rebound since scopeBar does not contain print:)`

>> bind code scopeBar == ...

`   ; Now run the code and we see someWord was rebound to scopeBar's value`

>> do code bar

`   ; Do another rebind, this time to scopeMumble` +
`   ; (print is rebound this time as well, since we redefined it)`

>> bind code scopeMumble == ...

`   ; This time we don't print "mumble", we reverse it instead!`

>> do code == "elbmum"

`   ; Rebinding print inside of Code won't affect new instances`

>> print "Hello World" Hello World 

You can imagine that this flexibility affords significant power,
although the potential for redefining the interpreter in a way that
could seriously confuse things. The self-modifying character is
something like a game of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic[Nomic], and
much like in Nomic there are tools to help make parts of the system
immutable. (See for instance PROTECT.)

  document describing Rebol's so-called "Bindology"._


MAKE OBJECT! vs. CONTEXT vs. OBJECT vs. CONSTRUCT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no difference between a context and an object in Rebol,
although idiomatically the functions used to construct them are applied
to slightly different cases. MAKE OBJECT! is the basic one, it collects
all set-words in the top-level code block and makes an object out of
them, then executes the code in the block, which can have side effects.

 make-employee: func [name id] [ employee: make object! compose [
name: (name) id: (id) ] return employee ]

e1: make-employee "Alice" 100 e2: make-employee "Bob" 101 

CONTEXT is just a shortcut for MAKE OBJECT!. CONTEXT is typically used
in situations where some code contains assignments that are not supposed
to contaminate the enclosing context. In the example below, the presence
of a context means that an inner loop index can be given the same name
as the outer loop index, while not overwriting it:

 fill-terminal-screen: func [letter [char!]] [ for index 1 25 1 [ ;
'index is local to for context [ index: 0 while [++ index 

OBJECT is basically the same as CONTEXT, except the value NONE is is
appended to the end of the code block so that assignment at the end of
the code block won't just throw an error, it will assign the NONE as a
default value.

 ; Put an object specification block into Objspec

>> objspec: [a: 10 b:] == [a: 10 b:]

`   ; A trailing SET-WORD! with no value is unacceptable for CONTEXT!`

>> context objspec

* ** Script error: b: needs a value
** Where: make context
** Near: make object! blk

`   ; Note that CONTEXT did not modify the object specification`

>> probe objspec [a: 10 b:] == [a: 10 b:]

`   ; The trailing SET-WORD! with no value is tolerated by OBJECT`

>> foo: object objspec == make object! [ a: 10 b: none ]

`    ; But the specification block itself has been modified`

>> probe objspec [a: 10 b: none] == [a: 10 b: none]

`    ; You can generate another object from the spec`

>> bar: object objspec == make object! [ a: 10 b: none ]

`    ; ...but it will add another none to the end of the spec block`

>> probe objspec [a: 10 b: none none] == [a: 10 b: none none] 

::
  _Note: Since this can leak if you have a static specification that you
  reuse several times in the same function, the behavior is under
  reconsideration for R3. See the Talk:Scoping in Rebol[Talk Page]_

The original code block is modified rather than a copy made to save on
block copy overhead. OBJECT is typically used to create object
prototypes, where the object is only created once and all that matters
is that the right fields are included, and the code block is not reused.
This happens quite often in GUI systems.

CONSTRUCT is different though: It doesn't do any evaluation, it just
creates the object and assigns literal values. By default though,
CONSTRUCT does some tricks:

* The standard words for the logic values - 'true, 'false, 'on, 'off,
(R3 only: 'yes, 'no) - are converted to their associated logic values.
The word 'none is also converted to the NONE value.
* Lit-words are converted to words.
* Lit-paths are converted to paths.
* R3 only: Unset values are converted to NONE.

These are all of the rules that are needed to make it easier to use
CONSTRUCT for its primary purpose: To create objects from script or
module header blocks. For instance, LOAD in R3 uses CONSTRUCT
internally.

CONSTRUCT is very forgiving of errors as well, and won't complain if the
spec block doesn't follow the set-word, value pairs list model.
CONSTRUCT only takes the immediate symbol after each SET-WORD! and
throws the rest away, like this:

 >> construct [ a: 10 + 20 print "Hello" b: 30 + 40 ] == make
object! [ a: 10 b: 30 ] 

If you don't want CONSTRUCT to do those tricks and want to just assign
the literals as-is, and are lucky enough to be using R3, then use
CONSTRUCT/only. The /only option means only assign the values, no
translation. CONSTRUCT/only will even assign unset or error values; that
kind of thing would throw an error if you used CONTEXT. CONSTRUCT/only
is typically used to construct objects from spec blocks that are
generated by other code.

The /only option here is used in the standard REBOL manner: Do the
"nice" thing by default, and do the more tricky, exact thing with /only.
As always, /only is the best friend of the experienced REBOL programmer
doing advanced code.


FUNC vs. FUNCT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most popular way of defining functions in Rebol historically has
been using FUNC. In order to allow the programmer to carefully control
the declaration, it requires you to specifically list which words are to
be used as local variables.

 ; Initialize foo and bar to be strings with "global" in their
names

>> foo: "global foo" == "global foo"

>> bar: "global bar" == "global bar"

`   ; Define a test function that calls out foo as a local, but not bar`

>> test: func [/local foo] [ print ["BEFORE(foo):" foo] print
["BEFORE(bar):" bar]

`   foo: "local foo"` +
`   bar: "local bar"`

`   print ["AFTER(foo):" foo]` +
`   print ["AFTER(bar):" bar]` `]` `== ...`

`   ; Run test and see that the global foo is hidden, but not the global bar`

>> test BEFORE(foo): none BEFORE(bar): global bar AFTER(foo): local foo
AFTER(bar): local bar

`   ; See that the global foo was unchanged`

>> print foo global foo

`   ; But bar was overwritten by the function!`

>> print bar local bar 

It is relatively easy to add a new SET-WORD! to the body of a function
that one intends to be local and forget to add it to the /LOCAL list.
It's also easy to forget to remove a local after a SET-WORD! has been
deleted or renamed.

Yet there is an efficiency gain by coding in this way, because when the
function object is being constructed there is no need to scan the body
for SET-WORD! instances. By providing the list of locals the programmer
assists the interpreter, reducing the time it takes to create the
function instance (though it does not affect the time it takes to _call_
the function after the creation).

Savvy Rebolers have known it's possible to scan the body of the function
for SET-WORD! and make them local by default. As of
http://www.rebol.com/article/0447.html[Rebol 2.7.7] this has shipped
with the interpreter as something called FUNCT.

 ; Initialize foo and bar to be strings with "global" in their
names

>> foo: "global foo" == "global foo"

>> bar: "global bar" == "global bar"

`   ; Define a test function that automatically makes SET-WORD! local by default`

>> test: funct [] [ print ["BEFORE(foo):" foo] print ["BEFORE(bar):"
bar]

`   foo: "local foo"` +
`   bar: "local bar"`

`   print ["AFTER(foo):" foo]` +
`   print ["AFTER(bar):" bar]` `]` `== ...`

`   ; Run test and see that the global foo and bar are hidden`

>> test BEFORE(foo): none BEFORE(bar): none AFTER(foo): local foo
AFTER(bar): local bar

`   ; See that the global foo was unchanged`

>> print foo global foo

`   ; And the global bar was also left alone!`

>> print bar global bar
