default. ROUND is a function value.

Description

"Rounding is meant to loose precision in a controlled way." -- Volker
Nitsch

ROUND is a very flexible rounding function. With the various refinements
and the scale option, you can easily round in various ways. Most of the
refinements are mutually exclusive--that is, you should use only one of
them--the /TO refinement is an obvious exception; it can be combined
with any other refinement.

By default, ROUND returns the nearest integer, with halves rounded up
(away from zero).

 probe round 1.4999

probe round 1.5

probe round -1.5  If the result of the rounding operation
is a number! with no decimal component, and the SCALE value is not time!
or money!, an integer will be returned. This makes it easy to use the
result of ROUND directly with iterator functions such as LOOP and
REPEAT.

The /TO refinment controls the "precision" of the rounding. That is, the
result will be a multiple of the SCALE parameter. In order to round to a
given number of decimal places, you don't pass in the number of decimal
places, but rather the "level of precision" they represent. For example,
to round to two decimal places, often used for money values, you would
do this:

 probe round/to $1.333 .01  To round to the
nearest 1/8, often used for interest rates, you would do this:

 probe round/to 1.333 .125  To round to the
nearst 1K increment (e.g. 1024 bytes):

 probe round/to 123'456 1024  If the /TO
refinement is used, and SCALE is a time! or money! value, the result
will be coerced to that type. If SCALE is not used, or is not a time! or
money! value, the datatype of the result will be the same as the valued
being rounded.

The /EVEN refinement is designed to reduce bias when rounding large
groups of values. It is sometimes called Banker's rounding, or
statistical rounding. For cases where the final digit of a number is 5
(e.g. 1.5 or 15), the previous digit will be rounded to an even result
(2, 4, etc.).

 repeat i 10 [val: i + .5 print [val round/even val]]

repeat i 10 [val: i * 10 + 5 print [val round/even/to val 10]]
 The /DOWN refinement rounds toward zero, ignoring
discarded digits. It is often called "truncate".

 probe round/down 1.999

probe round/down -1.999

probe round/down/to 1999 1000

probe round/down/to 1999 500  The /HALF-DOWN refinement
causes halves to round toward zero; by default they are rounded up.

 probe round/half-down 1.5

probe round/half-down -1.5

probe round/half-down 1.50000000001

probe round/half-down -1.50000000001  The /HALF-CEILING
refinement causes halves to round in a positive direction; by default
they are rounded up (away from zero). This works like the default
behavior for positive values, but is not the same for negative values.

 probe round -1.5

probe round/half-ceiling -1.5  /FLOOR causes numbers with
any decimal component to be rounded in a negative direction. It works
like /DOWN for positive numbers, but not for negative numbers.

 round/floor 1.999

round/floor -1.01

round/floor -1.00000000001  /CEILING is the reverse of
/FLOOR; numbers with any decimal component are rounded in a positive
direction.

 round/ceiling 1.01

round/ceiling 1.0000000001

round/ceiling -1.999  If you are rounding extremely large
numbers (e.g. 562'949'953'421'314), or using very high precision decimal
values (e.g. 13 or more decimal places), you may run up against REBOL's
native limits for values and its internal rounding rules. The ROUND
function is a mezzanine and has no control over that behavior.

Sometimes, it might appear that ROUND is doing something strange, so
before submitting a bug to RAMBO, think about what you're actually
asking it to do. For example, look at the results from this piece of
code:

 repeat i 10 [ scale: .9 + (i * .01) print [scale
round/down/to 10.55 scale] ]  The results approach 10.55
for values from 0.91 to 0.95, but then jump back when using values in
the range 0.96 to 0.99. Those are the expected results, because you're
truncating, that is, truncating to the nearest multiple of SCALE.

The design and development of the ROUND function involved many members
of the REBOL community. There was much debate about the interface (one
function with refinement versus individual functions for each rounding
type, what words to use for parameter names, behavior with regards to
type coercion).
