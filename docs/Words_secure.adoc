Description
+++++++++++

This function controls file and network access. It uses a dialect to
specify security "sandboxes" that allow or deny access. You can set
different security levels and multiple sandboxes for networking, files,
and specific files and directories.

The argument to the SECURE function can be a word or a block. If you
provide a word, a global security level is set for all accesses. If you
provide a block, you can specify separate security for files,
directories, and networking.

For example, if you write:

 secure ask  the user will be prompted on all
file and network accesses. But, if you provide a block as the argument:

 secure [ net quit file ask %./ allow ]  you
will disable networking (will force a quit if attempted), but ask for
user approval for all file access, except to the local directory (which
will be allowed).

As you can see, the security dialect consists of a block of paired
values. The first value in the pair specifies what is being secured
(file or net), and the second value specifies the level of security
(allow, ask, throw, quit). The second value can also be a block to
further specify read and write security.

The security levels are:

ALLOW - removes all read and/or write restrictions.

ASK - restricts immediate read and/or write access and prompts the user
for each access attempt, requiring approval before the operation may be
completed.

THROW - denies read and/or write access, throwing an error when a
restricted access attempt is made.

QUIT - denies read and/or write access and quits the script when
restricted access is attempted.

For example, to allow all network access, but to quit on any file
access:

 secure [ net allow ;allows any net access file quit ;any
file access will cause the program to quit ]  If a block is
used instead of a security level word, it can contain pairs of security
levels and access types. This lets you specify a greater level of detail
about the security you require. The access types allowed are:

READ - controls read access.

WRITE - controls write, delete, and rename access.

EXECUTE - controls execute access.

ALL - controls all access.

The pairs are processed in the order they appear, with later pairs
modifying the effect of earlier pairs. This permits setting one type of
access without explicitly setting all others. For example:

 secure [ net allow file [ ask all allow read quit execute ]
]  The above sets the security level to ask for all
operations except for reading (which is allowed).

This technique can also be used for individual files and directories.
For example:

 secure [ net allow file quit %source/ [ask read] %object/
[allow all] ]  will prompt the user if an attempt is made
to read the %source directory, but it will allow all operations on the
%object directory. Otherwise, it uses the default (quit).

If no security access level is specified for either network or file
access, it defaults to ASK. The current settings will not be modified if
an error occurs parsing the security block argument.

The SECURE function returns the prior security settings before the new
settings were made. This is a block with the global network and file
settings followed by file or directory settings. The word QUERY can also
be used to obtain the current security settings without modifying them:

 probe secure query  Using QUERY, you can modify
the current security level by querying the current settings, modifying
them, then using the secure function to set the new values.

Note that lowering the security level produces a change security
settings requestor to the user. The exception is when the REBOL session
is running in quiet mode which will, instead, terminate the REBOL
session. No request is generated when security levels are raised. Note
that the security request includes an option to allow all access for the
remainder of the scripts processing.

When running REBOL, the -s argument can be provided on the command line
to specify an initial security of:

 secure allow  The +s argument will specify:

 secure quit  You can also use the --secure
argument to specify any other default security level on REBOL startup.
