Overview
~~~~~~~~

V 2.200.12 includes a way to profile your code.

Although it's just a starting point (more is needed), it can provide
useful information.

Statistics information is returned from the STATS function.

 >> ? stats USAGE: STATS /show /profile /timer /evals

DESCRIPTION: Provides status and statistic information about the
interpreter. STATS is a native value.

REFINEMENTS: /show -- Print formatted results to console /profile --
Returns profiler object /timer -- Returns high resolution timer
(nanoseconds) /evals -- Returns number of values evaluated 

NOTE: The timer only works on hardware that provides a high
performance timer.


Profile Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example that shows profile information as of the first prompt
after boot:

 >> stats/profile == make object! [ timer: 1558343515056 ; timer in
nanoseconds (since OS boot) evals: 16513 ; number of values evaluated
eval-natives: 1832 ; series allocated eval-functions: 284 ; series
deallocated series-made: 5626 ; series expanded series-freed: 1427 ;
bytes requested by series series-expanded: 30 ; series reclaimed by
recycle series-bytes: 819454 ; natives evaluated series-recycled: 1396 ;
functions evaluated (non-native) made-blocks: 3793 ; blocks created
made-objects: 69 ; objects created recycles: 1 ; garbage collections ]


So, this is what the boot required. Note that the time is not the
startup time, it is your computer's high-performance timer value.

Now, call the HELP function and then check STATS again:

 >> help To use HELP, supply a word or value as

`       help insert`

...

>> stats/profile == make object! [ timer: 1558351665864 evals: 16524
eval-natives: 1839 

Here, let's try listing the directory:

 >> ls 1000cows.r ... (about 55 files)

>> stats/profile == make object! [ timer: 1558361784940 evals: 18248
eval-natives: 2584 


DP - Delta Profile Mezzanine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to DT for time, there is a DP function for showing differences
in the profile when evaluating a specific block:

 >> dp [loop 10 [a: 10]] == make object! [ timer: 11 evals: 31
eval-natives: 4 eval-functions: 1 series-made: 1 series-freed: 0
series-expanded: 0 series-bytes: 432 series-recycled: 0 made-blocks: 1
made-objects: 0 recycles: 0 ] 

Let's check the tiger.r SVG for a few hundred frames:

 >> dp [do %tiger.r] == make object! [ timer: 4989979 evals: 7085
eval-natives: 3349 eval-functions: 214 series-made: 537 series-freed: 4
series-expanded: 4 series-bytes: 382035 series-recycled: 0 made-blocks:
504 made-objects: 3 recycles: 0 ] 

Useful info! It shows that REBOL's graphics system is quite efficient.


Useful Observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The series-expanded field is a useful measurement of how well a
programmer did in determining the sizes required for series.

Note the difference between these two examples:

 >> str: "" >> dp [loop 10000 [append str "a"]] == make object! [
timer: 4516 evals: 30011 eval-natives: 10004 eval-functions: 1
series-made: 9 series-freed: 8 series-expanded: 8 series-bytes: 22784
series-recycled: 0 made-blocks: 1 made-objects: 0 recycles: 0 ] 

 >> str: make string! 15000 >> dp [loop 10000 [append str "a"]] ==
make object! [ timer: 4351 evals: 30011 eval-natives: 10004
eval-functions: 1 series-made: 1 series-freed: 0 series-expanded: 0
series-bytes: 432 series-recycled: 0 made-blocks: 1 made-objects: 0
recycles: 0
