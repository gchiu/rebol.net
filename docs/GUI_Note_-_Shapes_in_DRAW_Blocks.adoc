In the link:R3_GUI[R3 GUI], styles depend on link:Draw[DRAW blocks] for
specifying graphical rendering.

The GUI Draw-Face function optimizes the draw by reducing the DRAW block
prior to its usage. This is done to cache the final DRAW block for
rendering. Subsequent refreshes of the same face can use the cached
block, rather than rebuilding it again from the style and face
definitions.

Note, however, that *only the draw block itself is reduced in advance*.
Any sub-blocks of the DRAW block are not reduced (hence are not copied
when cached). They are used by reference.

This is important for the SHAPE command which uses a block as an
argument. The block holds the shape's definition. *It is assumed that
the shape is context independent.* It is a static shape definition, such
as an icon description, arrow graphic, etc. If necessary, it is allowed
to contain shape-relative facets, but *it should not contain
face-relative facets*, such as a size or area-size.

Of course, you can transform the shape as necessary, such as rescaling
or rotating it, by defining a transformation matrix or one of the
transformation commands.

Normally, if you need a face-based graphical shape, you can use DRAW
commands directly. You do not need to use the SHAPE command.

If you require the rendering of a fully independent SVG, such as an icon
or other image, you can use a SHAPE to reference it.

Should you decide that you absolutely need to use a SHAPE definition
that contains face-relative facets, you can do so by building the shape
during face initialization. You will need to reduce all face-based
facets in the final block. Then, you can provide the SHAPE block itself
as a facet variable within the DRAW block.

For example, within the style:

 draw: [ pen red box shape shape-box ]
