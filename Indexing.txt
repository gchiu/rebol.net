Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This article is meant as an illustration of the principles behind
indexing. Unless stated otherwise, the examples were tested using:

`   rebol/version ; == 2.7.8.3.1`


Does 0 "exist"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the discussion in a "philosophical" way, let's discuss one of
the "philosophical" themes first.

Some opponents of 0 state: "0 does not even exist, it should not be
allowed as an index, then"

It is fair to admit that the question whether 0 "exists" may indeed be
resolved by stating that it actually does not "exist". However, that
does not mean the opponents of 0 could start to celebrate. The situation
is the same as with the number 1, e.g. Does 1 "exist"? Not "much", we
cannot find it in the real world any easier than we can find 0. Note
that many Greek mathematicians did not consider 1 to be "a number", so
to them 2 was "the smallest number" (they used the term "multitude" and
it is easy to see why they considered inappropriate to call 1
"multitude").

It suffices to say that 1 is not something that "exists" in the common
sense of the word, it is just an abstract notion invented by clever
people to point to the common property of a hand containing one apple, a
letter consisting of one page, a room in which one man is sitting, a net
containing just one fish, a purse containing just one coin, etc.

In a similar sense 0 is as an abstract notion pointing to the common
property of a hand containing no apple, an empty envelope, a room in
which nobody is sitting, a net containing no fish, an empty purse, etc.


What should an index be?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the purpose of referring to positions (elements) in a series like
REBOL blocks, strings, etc. we need an index value.

The index value should be an integer. This statement may look
uncontroversial, but it may be useful to mention the reasons why:

An element in a series may have a next element, its successor in the
series. The successor element is such an element that there is no
element between the element and its successor in the series.

In integer arithmetic there is also a successor operation. The successor
of an integer is the integer increased by one.

The correspondence between the successor operations in the series and in
the range of integers (the "successor to successor correspondence") is
the reason why integers are used for indexing.

When the successor to successor correspondence is maintained, other
operations are in correspondence as well, for example:

* skipping two elements in a series corresponds to adding 2 to the
index,
* skipping one element in a series corresponds to adding 1 to the index,
* skipping no element in a series (remaining at the same place, in fact)
corresponds to adding 0 to the index
* skipping one element backwards corresponds to subtracting 1 from the
index (or adding -1 to the index),
* skipping two elements backwards corresponds to subtracting 2 from the
index (or adding -2 to the index)

This also illustrates that when the successor to successor
correspondence is kept, knowing the index of one element we can
calculate indices of all other elements using addition.


X-based indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the successor to successor correspondence is kept, knowing the index
of one element in a series determines the indices of all other elements.
Usually, the element with the smallest index value is called the _base
element_. If the index of the "base element" is <code>x</code>, the
index is called _x-based_.


The NEXT function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <code>next</code> function is not an "indexing operator" not doing
any indexing for us (not defining any correspondence between indices and
positions in a series). However, as discussed above, the "successor to
successor correspondence" is crucial for indexing. Therefore, it is wise
to examine whether the NEXT function can serve as a successor operator.

The help string of the <code>next</code> function says:

`   "Returns the series at its next position."`

Let's test how it works:

`   s: [a]` +
`   index? s ; == 1` +
`   mold/all s ; == [a]` +
`   next-s: next s` +
`   index? next-s ; == 2` +
`   mold/all next-s ; == #[block! [a] 2]` +
`   same? next-s s ; == false`

In this case we took series <code>s</code> and used the
<code>next</code> function to obtain its successor <code>next-s</code>.
We obtained a new, distinct, "successor" series, as all our examinations
proved.

Also, there is one more property worth mentioning. The
<code>next-s</code> series is a tail, as the following test reveals:

`   same? next-s tail next-s ; == true`

However, if we continue using the <code>next</code> function on
<code>next-s</code>:

`   next-next-s: next next-s`

we get:

`   index? next-next-s ; == 2` +
`   mold/all next-next-s ; == #[block! [a] 2]` +
`   same? next-next-s next-s ; == true`

This illustrates that when supplying the tail series, the
<code>next</code> function does not yield its successor, instead it just
yields the series tail.


The SUCC function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine whether the <code>next</code> function is the successor
operator we need to find out whether it _could_ yield the successor of
the <code>next-s</code> series. If yes, then the <code>next</code>
function isn't actually the successor operator, and its help string is
misleading.

It turns out that our concerns are justified. To prove it, let's define:

<pre>succ: func [ "Returns the series at its next position." series
[series!] /local t ] [ t: tail :series insert/dup t #"^(00)" 1 + (index?
:series) - (index? :t) series: next :series clear :t :series ]</pre>

Now our testing reveals:

`   succ-next-s: succ next-s` +
`   mold/all succ-next-s ; == "#[block![a]3]"` +
`   same? succ-next-s next-s ; == false`

, i.e., we really obtained the successive position confirming our
concerns.


The benefits of the SUCC function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our new <code>succ</code> function is actually our proposal how the new
<code>next</code> function implementation should behave. Let's list some
of the advantages of the new behaviour.


Help string
+++++++++++

The help string of the <code>succ</code> function isn't misleading. This
is not a big advantage, however. For the original <code>next</code>
function implementation to not have a misleading help string it would
suffice to adjust the help string to "Returns the series at its next
position, stops at tail."


BACK function compatibility
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a bigger advantage. To demonstrate it, let's see how the current
<code>next</code> function behaves:

`   same? s: tail [a] back next s ; == false`

, while:

`   same? s: tail [a] back succ s ; == true`


More flexible indexing
++++++++++++++++++++++

Together with the improved <code>back</code> function it generates the
new, improved <code>skip</code> function, which definines new
(essentially "any base") indexing. (see the discussion in the SKIP
section)


PICK function compatibility
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Defining the new <code>curr</code> function and <code>pick</code>
function different index access methods become compatible (finally).


The BACK function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <code>back</code> function help string states:

`   "Returns the series at its previous position."`

Similarly as with the <code>next</code> function we may want to
determine whether the help string is misleading or not. We can find out
that the <code>back</code> function does not yield the preceding
position in case it obtains a head series.

Now we may want to find out whether it is actually possible to obtain a
position preceding the head. Like in the case of the <code>next</code>
function, such series exist in REBOL:

`   index? #[block! [1 2] -2] ; == -2`

Therefore, it makes sense to redefine the <code>back</code> function as
proposed for the <code>next</code> function, i.e., so that the function
yields a predecessor of the given <code>series</code> without stopping
at head.


Getting the value at the current position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Such a function already exists in R2, it is called <code>first</code>,
but there are several issues with it:

* the function name assumes that the current position is (relatively to
itself) indexed by 1. If the successor to successor correspondence is
kept, index 0 (relative to the current position) would need to be
assigned to the position immediately preceding the current position.
Opponents of this (relative) indexing method correctly object that it is
counterintuitive and uncomfortable for 0 to "point one step backwards
from the current position". The simple indexing arithmetic example below
demonstrates that such choice makes index arithmetic more complicated
than necessary. Last but not least, the function name doesn't need to
assume any (relative) index value.
* the behaviour of the <code>first</code> function was found
uncomfortable when compared to the behaviour of the <code>pick</code>
function in that it triggered an error for out-of-range (past-head, tail
or past-tail) positions.


The INDEX? function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <code>index?</code> function uses 1-based indexing, the "base
element" being the series head. The series head has index 1. The
correspondence between series successor and the integer successor
(addition of 1) looks like being kept.

When testing the above <code>succ-next-s</code> series we obtain:

`   index? succ-next-s ; == 2`

, while we know that all other indicators (the <code>mold/all</code>
output, the <code>same?</code> function) demonstrate that it is not
true.

Similarly as we patched the <code>next</code> function we can patch also
the <code>index?</code> function:

<pre>index?': func [ \{Returns the index number of the current position
in the series.} series [series! port!] /local t i ] [ t: tail :series
while [all [tail? :series not :series =? :t]] [ insert tail :series
#"^(00)" ] i: index? :series clear :t i ]</pre>

Now we obtain:

`   index?' next-s ; == 2` +
`   index?' next-next-s ; == 3`


The AT function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function uses different indexing than the <code>index?</code>
function, the indexing of positions is "relative to the given
<code>series</code> argument". If we examine the function thoroughly, we
find that "the base element" (the element with the smallest index) can
actually (depending on the situation) have any index not exceeding 1.
Example:

`   s: skip [a b c d e f] 3` +
`   at s -2 ; == [b c d e f]` +
`   at s -3 ; == [a b c d e f]`

However, the <code>at</code> function uses "ambiguous indexing":

`   at s 1 ; == [d e f g]` +
`   at s 0 ; == [d e f g]`

, since it assigns two different indices (0 and 1) to one position. The
ambiguous indexing cannot maintain the successor to successor
correspondence. Moreover, it is the only ambiguous-type indexing used,
i.e., it is not compatible with any other indexing used.


The SKIP function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <code>skip</code> function uses indexing relative to the
<code>series</code> argument as well, but, fortunately, it does not use
ambiguous indexing like the <code>at</code> function. Maintains the
correspondence between series positions and integers (its integer
argument is called "offset", but the argument name is not relevant).

Similarly as the <code>next</code> function, though, it does not skip
past tail, nor does it skip past head (interestingly, past-head
positions are equally possible in R2 as past-tail positions). While this
property looks like logically justifiable, there is a problem that this
property is not compatible with indexing used by the <code>pick</code>
function indexing.

Note that if <code>skip</code> were able to skip past head as well as
past tail, any-based indexing would be possible. That is of advantage
for some code, REBOL would be one of languages allowing any bounds for
series (when using the appropriate skip), not just nonpositive minimal
index and positive maximal index.


The PICK function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <code>pick</code> function uses indexing relative to the given
<code>series</code>. It is able to refer to the past-head:

`   pick [a b] -1 ; == none`

yielding <code>#[none]</code> in such case or past tail:

`   pick [a b] 3 ; == none`

yielding <code>#[none]</code> as well.

However, the <code>pick</code> function does not maintain the successor
to successor correspondence. Example:

`   s: skip [a b c d e f g] 3` +
`   pick s -1 ; == c` +
`   pick s 1 ; == d`

R2 assigns index -1 to the <code>c</code> element, while it does not
assign 0 (the successor of -1) to the <code>d</code> element, assigning
1 to it instead. Because of that, the index arithmetic (the arithmetic
correspondence between indices and positions in the series) is broken.


Simple index arithmetic task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define a <code>head-index?</code> function obtaining a series
<code>s</code> and an index value <code>i</code> yielding an index value
<code>j</code> such that the <code>pick s i</code> expression will be
equivalent to the <code>pick head s j</code> expression. Here are the
solutions comparing different approaches:

The solution working when the <code>index?</code> function and the
<code>pick</code> function both use indexing method compatible with the
<code>skip</code> function indexing method:

<pre>head-index?: func [s [series!] i [integer!]] [i + index? s]</pre>

(This solution is the simplest.)

The solution working when the <code>index?</code> function and the
<code>pick</code> function use the indexing methods from R3:

<pre>head-index?: func [s [series!] i [integer!]] [i - 1 + index?
s]</pre>

(This solution is the second simplest.)

The solution working in the present state of R2:

<pre>head-index?: func [s [series!] i [integer!]] [case [i < 0 [i -
index? s] i > 0 [i - 1 + index? s] i = 0 [0]]]</pre>

(This solution is the most complicated and it is neither "simple" nor
"arithmetic". Neither it can be, having to deal with a successor to
successor incompatible non-arithmetic indexing method.)

The <code>next</code> and <code>back</code> functions are not indexing
functions. However, if they don't yield true successor and predecessor,
they cannot be used for construction of a successor to successor
compatible index, i.e. of a system with fundamentally correct indexing
arithmetic.

The <code>skip</code> function based on true successor and predecessor
functions would generate the proper indexing arithmetic automatically,
but when based on incorrect principles, the indexing arithmetic
generated by this function will also become incorrect (having to handle
many unnecessary and incomfortable exceptions).

The <code>at</code> function is even worse:

* it generates ambiguous indexing adding more exceptions to the already
existing set of exceptions from the <code>skip</code> function
* it uses index shift (addition of 1) of the series position generating
some new boundary exceptions
* due to the newly introduced sets of exceptions and due to shifting
indexing generated by the <code>at</code> function is also incompatible
with the indexing generated by the <code>skip</code> function

The <code>pick</code> function is similarly bad as the indexing
generated by the <code>at</code> function:

* it generates "indexing hole" introducing new exceptions to the already
existing set of exceptions from the <code>skip</code> function
* it uses index shift (addition of 1) of the series position generating
the same additional boundary exceptions as the <code>at</code> function
* the <code>head-index?</code> function is quite complicated, most
probably not circumventing all the indexing bugs nevertheless
* the indexing is incompatible with the indexing generated by the
<code>skip</code> function
* the indexing is incompatible with the indexing generated by the
<code>at</code> function

The <code>index?</code> function is less general than other functions
(not defining relative indexing, just absolute indexing, both the
indexing generated by the <code>at</code> function as well as the
indexing generated by the <code>pick</code> function generalize it,
although they are mutually incompatible), yet it introduces unacceptable
bugs for past-tail positions.

For the mathematical model of REBOL series and for the definitions of
the new, improved indexing system see the
Mathematical_model_of_REBOL_series article.
