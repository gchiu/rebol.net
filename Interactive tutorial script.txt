  _Here is a place where a live "over-the-shoulder" tutorial can be

The http://tryruby.sophrinix.com/["Try Ruby!"] site is very popular in
the Ruby community, and for good reasons! It is an excellent way for
users to get a taste of a language in a guided way. Beyond the basic
convenience of not having to download an interpreter, it integrates
bite-sized indoctrination to Ruby similar to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_learning[programmed learning].

Thanks to the work of http://esperconsultancy.nl/[Esper Consultancy],
various Rebol interpreters can currently be
http://tryrebol.esperconsultancy.nl/[tried online]. However there is not
yet an integrated tutorial, and users are left for fend for themselves
in finding what statements to try. This page is a starting point for a
narrative which could serve as a guided tour of the ideas in Rebol,
inspired by what Try Ruby! has achieved.

As food for thought, you may want to look over the HTML file
http://github.com/Sophrinix/TryRuby/blob/master/public/tutorials/intro.html[with
all the text of Try Ruby!s tutorial]. It includes inline the regular
expressions it is scanning for to cue the next step. Wikipedia's
"Wikibook" on
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/REBOL_Programming/Programming_in_REBOL[The
Programming in Rebol] contains some inspiration for code samples and
writing copy.


Introduction
------------

*Got 15 minutes? Try the Tesla Roadster of programming!*

The Rebol language is from a parallel universe where Moore's Law stopped
scaling 10 years ago. Astoundingly, _their engineers implemented all our
current technology anyway_! In a single megabyte you'll find nearly
anything you can think of...including dynamic Unicode strings, a GUI
builder, modern network protocols, and date/currency arithmetic.

For the sake of science and your own curiosity, why not take a
test-drive to see what makes this alien artifact tick? To access the
bundled documentation just type help (also miraculously packed in the
1MB executable binary!)

In addition to Rebol's builtin methods, the following commands are
available:

* *learn* Start the 15 minute interactive tutorial. Trust me, it's very
interesting!
* *learn 2* Hop to chapter two.
* *clear* Clear screen. Useful if your browser starts slowing down. Your
command history will be remembered.
* *back* Go back one screen in the tutorial.
* *reset* Reset the interpreter if you get too deep. (or Ctrl-D!)


Using the Prompt
----------------

The window above with the blinking cursor is a Rebol prompt. Type a line
of Rebol code, hit Enter and watch it run!

Let's start with something cool: <tt>pick ["apple" "banana" "orange"]
2</tt>

`== "banana"`


The Series Concept
------------------

You just met <tt>pick</tt>, which is one of Rebol's operations for
working with series of items. It takes two arguments—in this case the
first is a block, while the second is the index of the block element to
extract.

(As you probably noticed, the indexing starts at 1 and not zero. Another
thing that may have stood out is that there weren't any commas between
elements. We'll talk more about that later!)

Every Rebol operation has a fixed idea about how many arguments they
take. We saw that pick wants two, but now let's try a series operation
that only expects one argument.

Try this: <tt>third ["apple" "banana" "orange"]</tt>

`== "orange"`


...ah, Shorthand!
-----------------

So <tt>third</tt> is equivalent to using <tt>pick</tt> with an index of
3. (If you're curious how high this has been defined by default, it goes
all the way up to <tt>tenth</tt>)

Rebol encourages programmers to string together words separated by
spaces—like in human languages. Our brains are naturally able to build
sentence structures in our mind, without relying too strongly on
parentheses and commas. Imagine how cumbersome it would be if I'd been
forced to write that last sentence with explicit indication of its
structure:

<blockquote><p>_(S (NP Our brains) are (VP (ADVP naturally) build (NP
sentence structures) (PP in (NP our mind , (PP without (S (VP relying
(ADVP too) (ADVP strongly) (PP on (NP (NP parentheses) and (NP
commas))))) .)))))_</p></blockquote>

The more "human" style is not as common in programming languages as the
"explicit" style. Rebol supports both, but for the moment let's try
stringing together pick and third to make a natural Rebol sentence!

Try this: <tt>pick third ["apple" "banana" "orange"] 2</tt>

`== #"r" `


A Processing Pipeline
---------------------

When your language instinct kicks in after using Rebol a bit, you won't
have trouble grokking that last expression. You probably already could!
It says to pick the second element out of the third entry in the
sequence "apple", "banana", "orange". Since the second letter of orange
is a lowercase R, that's the answer.

The hash mark is just Rebol's way of distinguishing between the single
character #"r" and the one-letter-long string object "r". Characters are
a simpler data type, used in a series to build the notion of a string.
But unlike C where a character is one-byte long, Rebol's character is a
Unicode abstraction, and only has a size when written out using a
certain encoding.

Notice the interesting fact that pick can choose letters out of strings
as easily as it can choose strings out of blocks! So there are no
special "string methods" in Rebol—only "series methods" that work on
many different types.

Can you guess the output of <tt>third pick ["apple" "banana" "orange"]
2</tt> ?

`== #"n"`


A Niftier Notation for \{Strings}
---------------------------------

You saw that strings can be enclosed in quotes, just like in most
languages. Rebol has a second way of expressing strings, which is to put
them inside curly braces.

Having a different character to start a string from what ends a string
is very useful, because it means you can nest them for any even pairing.
Also, apostrophes are used in non-code writing just as often as quotes
are. So if one has single and double quotes as the only option (as in
Java, Python, etc.) it's not much help.

Give this a try: <tt>print \{It's "rad" to use \{braces}...}</tt>

`It's "rad" to use {braces}...`


Word Word Word, Word is the _Word_
----------------------------------

Using curly braces for strings is an example of how Rebol is willing to
look and feel different, but not merely for the sake of difference. One
of its mottos is "inspired by theory, but driven by practice". So things
you find surprising often will come into focus after seeing examples of
how it reigns in complexity in actual scripts.

An even more surprising notion is that you'll often find yourself not
using delimiters at all. Many sequences of characters that would be
considered "illegal identifiers" in most languages are tolerated by
Rebol even when you don't put braces or quotes around them. What you get
is something called a <i>word</i>.

So far you've seen the words <tt>pick</tt>, <tt>first</tt>, and
<tt>third</tt>. They acted like functions, but now let's see them do a
new trick. Try: <tt>pick [first pick third] 2</tt>

`== pick`


The Use/Mention Distinction
---------------------------

You just saw what you think you saw...pick picked itself out of a
series! Somehow when pick was outside the block it acted like _code_,
and when it was inside the block it acted like _data_.

But what if you want to execute a block as Rebol code? That's where the
<tt>do</tt> command comes in. Like all Rebol functions, it knows how
many arguments it expects&mdash;just one, which is the block containing
the elements you want evaluated:

What happens when you try it on the block above? <tt>do [first pick
third]</tt>

`** Script error: third is missing its value argument` +
`** Where: do` +
`** Near: do [pick first third]`


Context Is Key
--------------

You can see why it's a good thing that Rebol doesn't try to evaluate
these blocks by default. Treating them as data opens up more
possibilities. What it enables are something called _dialects_, where
you can twist the meaning of Rebol's symbolic infrastructure to suit
your purpose.

This might excite you. This might frighten you. Or if you know LISP, it
might not really seem like much new under the sun (but bear with us, it
gets deeper!) :)

For the tip of the iceberg, try <tt>parse "aaa" [3 "a" end]</tt>

`== true`


The Parse Dialect
-----------------

The parse command takes two arguments. The first is a series to process
(in this case the string "aaa"). The second is a block containing the
"rules" for parsing. It returns true if the rules match.

Our rules in this case were [3 "a" end]. Though Rebol's <tt>do</tt>
doesn't really know what that means, parse interprets this as:

<blockquote><p><i>Match against three instances of the "a" string, and
advance the input on each match. If doing so leads us to be at the end
of the input string, consider the match successful.</i></p></blockquote>

Now let's meet another Rebol concept: <tt>compose [print (reverse
"lobeR")]</tt>

`== [print "Rebol"]`


Dialects Leverage the Interpreter
---------------------------------

What <tt>compose</tt> does is it takes the block you give it, looks for
expressions in parentheses, and evaluates them. What was parenthesized
is replaced with the result of the evaluation. Everything else is left
alone...that's why the <tt>print</tt> was kept as data, even though the
<tt>reverse</tt> was executed as code.

Though not as "wild" as <tt>parse</tt>, it does show that not every
dialect needs to involve a lot of work. Rebol is there to serve your
needs if you want to perform evaluations in the middle of your
functions. When your dialect wants to put in hooks for math or small
snippets of script code, just call <tt>do</tt>!

But now that you've seen creative uses of integers in a dialect and
parentheses used for something other than precedence, it's time for the
dark side. Brace yourself: <tt>1 + 2 * 3</tt>

`== 9`


No Operator Precedence
----------------------

Rebol's <i>DO dialect</i> (the one you'll be using quite a bit of the
time) is driven by a uniformity. Every operator knows how many arguments
it takes and it will consume them left to right. A very few infix
operators are provided to meet the readability needs of the most common
code cases, but there's no special magic.

So if you want precedence in the <i>DO dialect</i>, you'll need to use
parentheses. But we saw that parentheses are used by <tt>compose</tt> to
edit code. I's often considered best to think through how much clearer
your code might be if you finessed the need for explicit precedence, due
to deep issues like this.

Try this: <tt>print "one" "two" 1 + 2</tt>

`one` +
`== 3`


If It's Not In Brackets, It Runs
--------------------------------

Rebol just churned through that list in a way that makes perfect sense
if you know the rules. The first <tt>print</tt> looked for its one
parameter, found the string <tt>"one"</tt>, and ran (that much is
obvious.)

When it was finished with that, the interpreter found "two"... a string
which evaluated to itself and had no side effects. It disappeared into
the void. But the 1 + 2 at the end didn't disappear because it was the
last result of the expression. (As in Ruby function, Rebol always
evaluates to the last line of a series of statements.)

Now that you know, try this: <tt>if (1 > 2) [print "bad"] [print
"good"]</tt>

`== [print "good"]`


If Never takes an "Else" Block!
-------------------------------

Rebol does not have "if-then-else" in the usual sense. It has
<tt>if</tt> and <tt>either</tt>. Like all Rebol functions, they know
exactly how many parameters they expect. <tt>if</tt> wants two: an
expression to evaluate and a block of code to <tt>do</tt> if that
expression is true. <tt>either</tt> wants three: an expression to
evaluate, a block of code to <tt>do</tt> if the expression is true, and
a block of code to <tt>do</tt> if the expression is false.

Here the <tt>if</tt> clause consumed the expression and the first block,
and didn't run. Then it was done, and the evaluator came upon a block.
Because the print was inside a block it did not run, but the expression
evaluated to that block.

To get what the author of that probably intended, try: <tt>either (1 >
2) [print "bad"] [print "good"]</tt>

`"good"`


A Language Without Keywords
---------------------------

You may think that <tt>if</tt> and <tt>either</tt> are bizarre, and that
the Rebol-tail is wagging the Rebol-dog. But it's setting up a pattern
that once you understand it, you can adapt the language to your needs.
(etc...)
