*Ports are used to access external series such as files, networks,
consoles, events, databases, and more.*


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Ports are essential to all REBOL programs.* A port is used to transfer
data to and from files, to communicate over networks, to output and
input to the console, to detect events, such as mouse clicks on a user
interface, to access databases, and more.

This document will describe the basic concepts of ports and how they are
used. A range of working examples can be found in
link:Port_Examples[Port Examples]. And, more advanced concepts related
to ports are covered in a separate document,
link:Port_Implementation[Port Implementation]. It describes how to
construct your own special types of ports.

Most ports are implemented at the OS layer using Devices and are not
necessary to your usage or understanding of ports in general.


Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

You may be asking yourself, "Why do I need to know this?" The answer is
as simple as asking yourself, is a program useful without I/O (input and
output)? In REBOL, it is through ports that all I/O happens.

Yes, often the usage of a port will be hidden behind some other
function. For example, when you use the *load* function to obtain code,
such as a script, or data, such as a JPEG image, a port is being used at
a lower level.

So, although you may not need a deep knowledge of ports, at least some
understanding of what's going on will be helpful in using REBOL.


Changes from REBOL 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The REBOL 3 port system uses many of the same basic concepts as REBOL 2,
_but its design is completely different_.

Ports have been completely redesigned to make them simpler, faster, and
easier to use. Substantial effort has been made to remove the complex
and error prone mechanisms of R2, and replace them with a smarter,
streamlined system.

REBOL 2 ports were first introduced in the _REBOL/Core Users Guide_,
http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-14.html[Chapter 14 - Ports].
A lot of these basic concepts still apply to REBOL 3. For example, the
port functions such as open, close, read, and write still apply.
However, many details have changed.

The big changes are:

* The port object is completely different. It has been optimized and
structured to be more efficient.
* The structure of a scheme is completely new and more defined.
* Ports normally read and write binary, not strings. This change is
mainly the result of Unicode which can be encoded in many different
ways. Therefore, a string must be decoded using an appropriate method.
* Many of the port action refinements have been removed, because they
are no longer useful.
* Asynchronous I/O works differently.

What does this mean? In general, code written for ports that runs in
REBOL 2 will not work in REBOL 3. You will need to rewrite your code, at
least at the level of the port interfaces. If you need your code to work
in REBOL 2 and 3, we suggest that you cleanly isolate your port
functions within higher level functions. For well written code, you will
find that the difference only amounts to a few lines of code, perhaps
two or three pages maximum, for sophisticated applications.


Basic Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As stated above, a port is used to transfer data. However, the basic
port definition is a bit more general than that. A port is actually more
like a _stream of data_ that undergoes some type of exchange,
transformation, or effect.

For example, a port is often used for I/O functions such as:

* *console* input and output
* *file* reading and writing
* *directories* of files
* *network* transferring of data
* *event handling*, such as mouse clicks or keyboard input
* *database access*

But, a port can also be used for other types of functions:

* *image conversion* - such as encoding or decoding a JPEG file.
* *sound conversion* - such as encoding or decoding an audio file
* *checksum computation* - keeping a running checksum
* *compression and decompression* of data
* *encryption and decryption* of data
* *other codecs* for encoding and decoding data formats


Related to Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you know, REBOL is built on the concept of a
http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-6.html[- Series].

*A series is a set of values arranged in a specific order. It is a
sequence.*

A port is a special type of series. Not only is it a sequence, but it
can also hold _state information_ like an object, and access
link:devices[ external devices] for I/O or other high-speed operations,
such as image conversion or encryption.

In REBOL 2, ports were built on a pure series model. However, we found
this approach to be problematic because ports are not pure series. They
also embody state (information).

For example, a file can be thought of as a stream of bytes. But, a file
also has other important attributes such a file name, a location within
a directory, creation and modification dates, permissions like read-only
or allow execution, and ownership information. These attributes fall
outside of a pure series model.


New Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

REBOL 3 moves away from the pure series model of REBOL 2 and more toward
an I/O stream model. Now it is closer to the concept found in other
programming environments and languages.

So, a port can be defined as:

* *a series of values* - such as a sequence of bytes
* *holds state information* - such as file attributes
* can *access the external world* - network communication, for example
* *can have side effects* - internal changes, such as compression

The pure series model is gone. Ports are more pragmatic now, and this
has resulted in a port system that is cleaner, smaller, faster, and more
extensible than ever before.


Main Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A port consists of these main ideas:

1.  *A name* that specifies the general type of port (scheme)
2.  *An object* that holds information (state of port)
3.  *A set of functions* that are applied to that object (actions)

The name of a port is called a *'scheme*'. Example schemes are:

* *console*
* *file*
* *dir* - file directory
* *event* - gui events (mainly)
* *TCP* - networking
* *HTTP* - web connections
* *clipboard* - cut and paste
* *sound* - for audio output
* *system* - system state changes

Many other types of schemes can exist, and they are often built on top
of lower level schemes. For example, FTP for file transfer is built on
the TCP networking scheme.

Here is an example. In this line:

`   port: open tcp://www.rebol.net` +
`   data: read `http://www.rebol.com[`http://www.rebol.com`]

the first scheme is TCP; the second is HTTP. (Note that this is
consistent with the definition of a URL.)

The object holds information such as:

* the type of the port (file, network, database, etc.)
* the name and location (path) of a file
* the URI of a network connection
* a network host name and port number
* a buffer of data being transferred
* date and time info
* structures used by external devices

This object is of a specific REBOL _datatype_, called a _PORT!_

Specific _action functions_ can be applied to a port. Some common
actions are:

* *make* - create a new port
* *open* - initialize the port
* *close* - finalize the port
* *read* - read data from port
* *write* - write data to port
* *query* - get other information from port
* *update* - detect external changes to the port

But, there are many other actions as well, as generally defined by REBOL
datatypes.


Using Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~


Two Basic Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two basic methods to use a port: *implicit* and *explicit*.

When you write code such as:

`   write %index.html read `http://www.rebol.net[`http://www.rebol.net`]

you are using *implicit* ports. This is a shortcut notation to keep
simple code simple. You are only using a single port action, such as
*read* or *write* and all the other details are hidden behind those
functions.

However, if you write code such as:

`   file: open %data.dat` +
`   write file data1` +
`   write file data2` +
`   ...` +
`   close file`

then you are using *explicit* ports. Here you specify each action
separately. You *open* the port, then *read* and *write* to the port,
and then *close* the port. Each action must be specified.


Fast and Easy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implicit ports are the fast and easy way to perform various I/O actions
in REBOL.

A few examples are:

`   data: read %todo.dat` +
`   write %plans.r data` +
`   query %docs.txt` +
`   page: read `http://www.rebol.net[`http://www.rebol.net`] +
`   result: write `http://rebol.net/cgi/act.r[`http://rebol.net/cgi/act.r`]` data` +
`   data: read `ftp://www.rebol.net/projects.dat[`ftp://www.rebol.net/projects.dat`] +
`   host: read `dns://www.rebol.net[`dns://www.rebol.net`]

This type of usage depends on the type of port (the scheme). The example
above uses the file, http, ftp, and dns schemes. Those schemes have been
designed to support implicit actions.

Notice that for local files, the file datatype is used to indicate usage
of the file scheme. The line:

`   data: read `file://todo.dat[`file://todo.dat`]

is equally valid. Think of the file datatype as an abbreviation for
that. Both methods use the same file scheme to perform the I/O.

Other schemes do not support implicit usage. For example:

`   >> data: read tcp://www.rebol.com` +
`   ** Access error: Port is not open: tcp://www.rebol.com` +
`   ** Where: read` +
`   ** Near: read tcp://www.rebol.com`

This error occurs because TCP does not support an implicit *read*
action. That's because TCP is a lower level scheme that requires a
higher level protocol in order to be useful.


Full Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Explicit ports give you full control over each I/O action. For example,
let's say you want to read a large file in small 20000 byte chunks. You
might use these steps:

`   file: open %bigdata.dat` +
`   while [not zero? data: read/part file 20000] [` +
`       process data` +
`   ]` +
`   close file`

This common method will be familiar to most programmers. The file is
opened, reads are done, and the file is closed. Each action is done
separately.

This type of explicit I/O is common for large files that would consume a
lot of memory if you read them with implicit I/O. For example, if the
_bigdata.dat_ file is 10 GB, you would not be able to read it all into
memory at one time.

Explicit I/O is also used when you need strict control over each action.
This is often done if you need to seek to different locations within a
file or write your own network protocol.

For example, let's say you need to read data from three different parts
of a large file. In that case you would use read to seek to each part of
the file to do the read:

`   file: open %bigdata.dat` +
`   da-head: read/part file 4000` +
`   da-body: read/seek/part file 12000 10000` +
`   da-tail: read/seek/part file 56000 4000` +
`   close file`


Port Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes some of the important concepts you need to know
about ports.


Port Datatype
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A port is a REBOL datatype. If you use explicit ports, you will need to
use the port datatype as _a type of handle_ to access the port. If
you've used handles before in other languages, that concept is probably
familiar to you already.

In REBOL a port is very similar to an object because it stores
information in named fields. We often call these fields _the state_ of
the port. When various actions are performed, the state will change,
depending on the action. A port differs from an object in that it
responds in a special way to specific datatype actions such as *open*,
*read*, *write*, and several others.


Port Schemes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A _scheme_ is a type of port.

You will use schemes to identify the type of port access you need as
well as the protocol to use.

For example, when you access a local file, you are using the *file*
scheme. When you read a web page, you use the *http* scheme, which is a
higher level protocol built on top of the *tcp* scheme.

Each scheme has a unique name that is used to identify it. For example,
*file*, *http*, and *tcp* are the scheme names shown above. A scheme
name can be used as part of a URL, or separately, depending on
requirements.

The REBOL system manages a list of available schemes. These schemes can
be built-in, can be loaded separately, or can even be user defined
within a script.

A lot more about schemes can be found in the
link:Port_Implementation[Port Implementation] section.


Making Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^

All ports are made from a _spec_ -- a specification of the port's
attributes. As you have seen above, the spec can be something quite
simple, such as a file name or URL. But, a port spec can also be a block
that includes many fields to indicate various options for the port.

All of these can be used as port specs:

`   %file.txt  ; a file name` +
`   tcp://www.rebol.com ; a URL` +
`   [scheme: 'tcp host: "www.rebol.net"] ; a block` +
`   'tcp  ; just the port's scheme name` +
`   object ; an object that specifies the port` +
`   port ; a existing port`

There are a couple ways to make a port, depending on your required level
of control.

One method is to use the *make* action, as you would for any datatype.
The general form is:

`   port: make port! spec`

Where *port!* is the port datatype itself, and spec is the specification
as described above.

Here are some examples:

`   port1: make port! %file.txt` +
`   port2: make port! tcp://www.rebol.net` +
`   port3: make port! [scheme: 'tcp host: "www.rebol.net"]`

These examples will create a port object and initialize its various
fields.

One of the most common methods to create a port is with the *open*
function. Unlike *make* the *open* function does not require a port!
datatype. It knows that it is being provided with a spec. For example:

`   port: open tcp://www.rebol.net`

will create a new port and also perform initializations associated with
the *open* action.

More details about *open* are discussed later.


Port Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Port actions can be thought of as functions that act on ports.

More precisely, port actions are _polymorphic datatype actions_ similar
to those used on all other datatypes. If you're not sure what that
means, don't worry about it here. Just think of ports like objects that
have a well-defined set of methods that act on them.

The actions defined for ports are:

<blockquote>

make: make a new port object +
to: special (convert an object to a port) +
open: initialize external operations +
close: conclude external operations +
write: transfer data to the port +
read: transfer data from the port +
query: get information about the port +
update: update the port's state +
create: create an external object of port type +
delete: delete an external object of port type +
rename: rename an external object of port type::

</blockquote>

Note that not all port actions can be used on all port schemes. For
example, the *rename* action has no purpose when used on a _sound_ port
scheme.

Ports also allow basic equality comparisons:

<blockquote>

equal?: ports are the same object +
not-equal?: ports are not the same object::

</blockquote>

For the exact usage of each action use REBOL's built-in help function.
(In this way the action information is always accurate.)

<pre> >> ? open USAGE: OPEN spec /new /read /write /seek /allow access

DESCRIPTION: Opens a port. Makes a new port from a specification, if
necessary. OPEN is an action value.

ARGUMENTS: spec (port! file! url! block!)

REFINEMENTS: /new -- Create new file - if it exists, reset it (truncate)
/read -- Open for read access /write -- Open for write access /seek --
Optimize for random access /allow -- Specifies protection attributes
access (block!) </pre>

All of the port actions are provided with the port (or spec in the case
of implicit port usage) as their first argument.

See the link:Port_Examples[Port Examples] section for various examples
of how to use port actions.


Asynchronous Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Actions on a port can be _synchronous_ or _asynchronous_.

In general:

* *Synchronous actions* will not return until the requested function has
completed.
* *Asynchronous actions* will return as soon as possible, even if the
function is still being performed.

Both modes are useful, depending on program requirements.

Whether an action happens asynchronously depends on a few things. Here
are the basic rules:

* Implicit port usage is synchronous. This provides ease-of-use.
* Explicit port usage is asynchronous, but only if the port scheme
supports it and an awake handler has been provided.
* Some actions are synchronous, even when applied to an asynchronous
port.

Note that it is possible to operate an asynchronous port in a
synchronous manner, when so desired. But, it is not possible to operate
a synchronous port in an asynchronous manner. (To do so, you must use a
REBOL task as an asynchronous thread.)

See the link:Port_Examples[Port Examples] page for examples of both
modes of operation.


Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, port actions can generate errors in the same way as other
REBOL functions, and you can catch and process these _error exceptions_
in the same way.

For example, if you want to handle an error during an *open* action, you
can wrap the code with an error handling function such as *try*:

`   if error? err: try [port: open spec] [` +
`       handle-error err` +
`   ]`

A shorthand method is to use *attempt*:

`   either port: attempt [open spec] [` +
`       perform-io...` +
`   ][` +
`       print ["Cannot open" spec]` +
`   ]`

So, you can wrap each separate port action in an error handler, or you
can wrap all of your port actions together in a single error handler:

`   err: try [` +
`       file: open %bigdata.dat` +
`       da-head: read/part file 4000` +
`       da-body: read/seek/part file 12000 10000` +
`       da-tail: read/seek/part file 56000 4000` +
`   ]` +
`   close file`

`   if error? err [` +
`       print ["Port error:" form err]` +
`   ]`

For asynchronous port operation, error handling can be a bit more
complicated. _(And more work is needed here.)_
