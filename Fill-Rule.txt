FILL-RULE
~~~~~~~~~

Determines the algorithm used to determine what area to fill, if a path
that intersects itself or one subpath encloses another. For
non-intersecting paths, you shouldn't need to use this.

|mode |[word!] |Fill algorithm |*non-zero* - This rule determines the
"insideness" of a point on the canvas by drawing a ray from that point
to infinity in any direction and then examining the places where a
segment of the shape crosses the ray. Starting with a count of zero, add
one each time a path segment crosses the ray from left to right and
subtract one each time a path segment crosses the ray from right to
left. After counting the crossings, if the result is zero then the point
is outside the path. Otherwise, it is inside. *even-odd* - This rule
determines the "insideness" of a point on the canvas by drawing a ray
from that point to infinity in any direction and counting the number of
path segments from the given shape that the ray crosses. If this number
is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.
