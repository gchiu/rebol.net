Rebol View provides a desktop GUI - the viewtop. The viewtop provides a
vital first impression, a chance to showcase the potential of the Rebol
language. The viewtop does quite well as a convenient method of writing
and organizing scripts.

Can a revised viewtop better illustrate the flexibility of Rebol as a
language and how Rebol might be used as a platform for distributed
computer communication?

Consider the task of skinning the viewtop as an example of Rebol
flexibility. How many skins have been put forward? One - titled
"Desktop", the file %active-viewtop.r, entered to the script library
2005-08-31 and authored by "RT & Ingo Hohmann. As Rebol is indeed an
extremely flexible and elegant language, perhaps there are more
viewtops.

The source code of the viewtop has been made available (and can also be
gained by typing mold ctx-viewtop at the console).

The collection of Rebsites is an interesting conglomeration - but it may
also be useful to build a more focused network, or provide an example of
business or scientific networks to demonstrate Rebol's distributed
computing capabilities.

This first viewtop skin illustrated below is an incomplete work, a bad
hack at best, but it does provide a starting point or perhaps an
incentive for others to do better. I hope that they may post their
viewtops below this one and that in time a consensus of what a better
viewtop ought to be may develop.

This viewtop includes major services like the Cheyenne web server and
the Altme messaging application.

From the top bar one may currently set preferences, change to the
console mode, and open the editor. A provision for the Cheyenne web
server and Altme have also been made but as yet are not functional. Both
Cheyenne and Altme can be opened from the list of scripts and
applications in the main body of the layout.

Changes to the original script include:

\1. To simplify the layout, only one icon was chosen to represent files
and folders, applications and scripts. The data of the icon image
provides the text for each item. Currently, new items and edits to
existing items are done with the editor - but a script could be written
for this.

\2. Some items were given new names that may be more descriptive,
hopefully making the reading of the script a bit easier.

\3. The initialization of items was removed. This viewtop script runs
from the user.r file.

\4. Images not used were removed from the script.

\5. The earth image used instead is from NASA, a USA government image.

The script for the illustrated viewtop will be presented here in the
near future.
********************************************************************************************

The version of Rebol that includes GUI libraries has been historically
called "REBOL/View". Included in the distribution is a function called
<tt>viewtop</tt>, which starts a simple browser application that lets
you run sample Rebol programs from some trusted network locations.


Index
^^^^^

The viewtop is able to get its index of demos from any file or URL,
however the default is:

<pre> >> viewtop http://rebol.com/index.r </pre>

By using an

optional parameter], it is possible to subvert Rebol's usual requirement
that a function take a fixed number of parameters and merely type:

<pre> >> viewtop </pre>

  series of commands, and is intended only for functions designed for
  usage in interactive mode!_


Security

  off the network, and how to check to make sure security is set and
  working.
