REBOL pairs are commonly used to represent positions or sizes of objects
in two-dimensional graphic layouts. They are implemented as pairs of
32-bit floating point values in the newest versions of R3 and
interpreted as representing the coordinates in pixels.


Why the subpixel resolution is needed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  REBOL display engine uses AGG, which supports positions precise to 1
/ 256 pixel, therefore it is not reasonable to limit ourselves to less
precise input, than the graphic engine already supports
2.  For scaling, we need higher precision, than what we can display,
since if we rescale a picture doubling its size, former difference of
0.5 pixel becomes 1 pixel difference
3.  When displaying the picture on a different medium than the display,
higher resolution is needed for the picture to look good
4.  Current R3 GUI resizing already uses subpixel pair resolutions to
maintain higher accuracy in some cases

The alternatives that were considered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These were proposed as possible alternatives, before the FP pair variant
prevailed:


Using the integer pair implementation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It may be a surprise for many, but, actually, we don't even have to
change the implementation of REBOL pair to achieve subpixel accuracy.
The only thing we have to do is define, how REBOL pairs are interpreted.
If we state, that REBOL pairs are interpreted as dimensions in
subpixels, where every subpixel is e.g. a 1 / 65536 of a pixel (later on
I shall explain, why this "magic number" looks reasonable to me), then
we are done, no other pair implementation change is totally necessary.


How to load, mold, form pairs with subpixel accuracy?

To support the subpixel accuracy we can adjust the LOAD, MOLD, FORM
functions to take the subpixel interpretation into account. This is how
we can modify the LOAD function to accept two decimal coordinates X and
Y for a pair:

<pre>; this defines the interpretation (accuracy) of the pair:
subpixel-count: 65536 load-pair: func [ \{convert decimal coordinates to
subpixels} x [number!] y [number!] ] [ return (x * subpixel-count + 0.5
* 1x0) + (y * subpixel-count + 0.5 * 0x1) ] mold-pair: func [ \{mold a
subpixel accuracy pair to a "human readable" form} s [pair!] \{a
subpixel-accuracy pair} ] [ rejoin [round/to s/x / subpixel-count
0.000015 "x" round/to s/y / subpixel-count 0.000015] ]</pre>
<pre>;example usage

a 123.45x678.90 pair::

load-pair 123.45 678.90 ; == 8090419x44492390 (this would be the
"internal representation") mold-pair 8090419x44492390 ; ==
"123.45x678.9"</pre>


Why 1 / 65536 pixel looks like a reasonable accuracy?

As stated above, REBOL graphic engine can already handle 1 / 256 of a
pixel, i.e. 8 bits of subpixel accuracy. To have some reserve for other
purposes, like scaling, displaying on other devices, it is useful to
have a reserve, which is enabled by the use of 16 bits of subpixel
accuracy.


How to implement REBOL pair keeping the "original" 32-bit integer range?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Currently in R3, as well as in R2, all 32 bits are used for
"pixel-and-above" accuracy. To get the same range while devoting 16 bits
for subpixel accuracy we would need 48 bits per coordinate, i.e. 96 bits
in total for the pair, which seems to be perfectly "in reach" of the
current REBOL value implementation. Similarly as now, both coordinates
would be integers, just 48-bit. They would be interpreted as coordinates
given in 1 / 65536 of a pixel, i.e. in subpixels exactly as above.


REBOL pair implemented as a pair of floats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the alternative, that was chosen, finally. REBOL pairs were
implemented as pairs of 32-bit IEEE 754 floats, which gives us 24-bit
accuracy in total for every coordinate.


Properties
++++++++++

Due to the fact, that AGG actually needs 64-bit IEEE 754 (decimal!)
coordinates, and a pair of decimals does not fit into one REBOL value
slot currently, the next value fastest to convert to 64-bit IEEE 754
value is a 32-bit IEEE 754 value. (Integer subpixel values would need a
floating point multiplication, which would be slower.)

The maximal integer coordinate expressible with at least a one pixel
precision would be 16777216. (2 ** 24)


Pair Actions and Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* make
* to

Binary actions between pair! and also with number! values:

* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide
* remainder
* comparison (equal, etc.)

Binary functions:

* minimum
* maximum

Unary actions:

* odd
* even
* negate
* complement
* absolute
* reverse
* random

Indexing:

* pick
* skip
* at
* change
* copy
* index?
* insert
* remove
* take


Changes to pair actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The COMPLEMENT function is not supported for REBOL decimals. Since any
of these changes would make pair coordinates more similar to decimals,
it would lose meaning to keep the support for computing pair
complements.
