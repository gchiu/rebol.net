*on-drop* can be invoked after
*link:The_Face_Object_Field_-_Actors_-_on-click[on-click]*, if a drag
object exists and a mouse up event for either left, middle or right
button happens.

After on-drop, the drag object is automatically destroyed. on-drop is
used regardless of whether the drag operation was started over this face
or a different face.

It can also be invoked if a file is dragged and dropped from the desktop
over the face.

The argument is the drag object. A return value is not necessary.
